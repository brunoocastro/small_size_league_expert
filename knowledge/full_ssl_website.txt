Technical Challenges of the Small Size League are intended to encourage teams to develop solutions to specific problems that will advance the quality of gameplay within the league. Teams are evaluated for their completion of the challenge during a designated time at RoboCup each year.
Rules
Below are the rules for the different RoboCup 2022 technical challenges. Source code associated with these challenges can be found on GitHub.

Vision Blackout Challenge
We will have the blackout challenge again to continue improving onboard sensing. There will be multiple phases with increasing difficulty again. This time, the focus will be on robot interaction: Two robots will need to collaborate with each other to score a goal.

DOCUMENT 6
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2012-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
Two technical challenges and the Mixed team tournament will be held this year.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committes encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Until April 25th, teams interested in participating in any of the challenges or in the Mixed team tournament need to announce their interest to the Organizing Committee . This is necessary for the preparation of the schedules.
Passing and Shooting Challenge
To test the ability of coordinated passing and motion of the teams, in an environment with moving obstacles, the following challenge is proposed: Up to four robots, placed within areas on each side the field, must pass and receive the ball across four moving obstacles, repositioning themselves according to the sequence shown in the figure below and, at the end, score the goal.
Rules
Every received pass scores +1, and every intercepted or missed pass scores -1;There’s a bonus of +3 for scoring the goal;If the ball is intercepted, stops or goes out of bounds, it will be placed on the start position;The moving obstacles will travel at 1m/s speed, with slight variation allowed;The location of the obstacle robots will follow the figure, however their exact position may vary slightly;Robots cannot leave the areas of the field designated for them;Chip kicks are not permitted; – item added as Rule Clarification (June 7th)The size of each passing area is 1.25m x 6.1m, measured from the bounds of the field;Teams have 2 minutes to complete the challenge;Wins the team with higher score.
Pass/Intercept Challenge
Attention: This challenge’s format has changed on April 10th
This challenge tests both the ability to pass the ball in a reduced space, with adversaries, and the ability to intercept the ball when defending. The challenge occurs between two teams, on a half of the field. One of the teams, with up to four robots, tries to pass the ball as many times as possible, while the other team uses two robots to try to intercept the passes. Robots are free to move anywhere, as long as they respect the minimum distance between them, as shown on the picture below. The two teams swap passing and defending roles at the half-time interval.
Rules
Every received pass scores +2 and every intercepted or missed pass scores -1;If the ball is intercepted, goes out of bounds or stops, a referee halt signal will be sent and the ball placed again around the goal kick position;Passing robots must keep minimum distance of 1m between teammates for passing score to be accounted;Defending robots must keep minimum distance of 0.5m from the robot holding the ball;Referee can penalize with -1 each offense to the minimum distance rules;Matches will consist of 2 periods of 2 minutes, with approx. 30 seconds interval between;Team with higher score wins;The challenge will follow eliminatory match style. Brackets will be drawn on the day of the competition.
Mixed Team Tournament
This is a full match between mixed teams, each composed of six robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each robot will be controlled by its originating SSL team software. However, communication between the teams is allowed, as long as there is no direct control of the robots. The tournament format will let teams play matches as members of different mixed teams.
* The exact number of matches and schedule will be announced by the OC after the team confirmation deadline.
Rules
Both teams forming the mixed team must have the same number of robots on the field at the beginning of a match;All SSL rules will apply;Goals are only valid if robots from the two forming teams have touched the ball since the last game stoppage;The mixed teams will be formed by seeding.The winner is based off two round robins, a preliminary and a final one with advanced teams.

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges and a demo will be held in Istanbul 2011.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate, and the Committes urge all the competing teams to compete in the challenges. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed from their previous versions.
Until June 20th (two weeks before the start of the competition), teams interested in participating in the challenge need to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.
Dynamic Navigation Challenge
**This challenge was used at the Iran open, with slight differences
The aim of this technical challenge is examine the ability of robots to safely navigate in a dynamic environment.
As it is shown in the pictures, there are 6 robots acting as obstacles, two stationary and four moving along a straight line. The approximate positions and trajectories are depicted in the figures. The actual position may vary.
1.1) The maximum number of participating robots are limited to 3.
1.2) The participating robots must navigate between the two stationary obstacles as shown in pictures.
1.3) Whenever a robot touches an obstacle or its teammate it will receive a penalty (-1).
1.4) Each successful navigation cycle for each robot is scored (+1).
1.5) Robots who can perform the cycle carrying the ball score (+3).
1.6) The challenge time is 2 minutes.
Mixed Team Match Challenge
This is a full match between mixed teams, each composed of five robots originating from two different SSL teams. One of the SSL teams must provide three robots and the other must provide two. Each robot will be controlled by its originating SSL team own software stack.
2.3) Teams who want to participate in this challenge must confirm its intention to the OC until June 20th. The OC also urges teams who want to participate to try to adjust their software before the match.
2.1) All SSL rules will apply
2.2) The mixed team can swap which of the originating teams provides three and which provides two robots
2.3) After the round robin stage of the soccer competition the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” become generated semi-randomly
Large Field Demo
A mixed match, similar to the Mixed Team Match Challenge, between 6 to 8 robots on each side, where each SSL Team will provide half of the robots for the mixed team. The field of play will consist of two official SSL-Fields joined as one, with SSL-Vision operating with four cameras. The log files of the demo games will be available after the competition to all SSL teams, and will serve to foster the development of systems capable of using the large field.
D.1) Teams who want to participate in this challenge must confirm its intention to the OC until June 20th.
D.2) All rules of the Mixed Team Challenge apply.
D.3) Participation on this demo is conditioned to participation on the Mixed Team Challenge

CONTENT:
If your team is planning on joining the Small Size League (SSL), there are a few things you have to arrange. They are summarized on this page.
Communication
Our main means of communication is the Small Size League mailing list. The mailing list is the place to be for SSL-related announcements and discussion. We require that at least one person from every team be subscribed to this mailing list in order to receive important announcements. Once you are subscribed, you can post your own messages as well. Please be considerate of other subscribers’ time and energy and avoid posting unnecessarily. You can subscribe to the mailing list here.
Next to the mailing list, we have a Discord Server. Most team members are part of this server. This is where you can easily ask other teams for advice or help. Additionally, important league announcements are posted on this server. You can join the server here.
Qualification
To qualify for the SSL of RoboCup, you need to submit a team description paper and team video. Details regarding the qualification process, including important deadlines and divisions, can be found under the ‘RoboCup year’ tab on our website. For example, the qualification details for 2022 can be found here.
League-shared software
The league uses various software in order to play the matches. Some of them use team-specific parameters, which you will need to submit yourself by creating a pull request. This includes:

Adding your team logo to the status-board

Adding your exact team name to the game controller

Adding your robot height to ssl-vision

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested in participating must complete the followingactions by the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, whichis specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2025 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact’s name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be conducted via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of thequalification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submitqualification video material demonstrating their true currentcapabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) whatis expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting the minimumrequired criteria will only be considered for inclusion after all teams thatsubmitted compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separatetournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advancedteams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B.Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will havethe final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such ateam will attend as one team and must submit all qualificationmaterials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiplecomputers.

 
Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a TeamDescription Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP.Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams thatpresent substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCuptournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced withrespect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described indetail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long. This does not include references.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team mustbring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. Theposter must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will behung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2025
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existingaccount, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To createan account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. Tosubmit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Qualification Process

After the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, the OC will reach out by email to all teams that submitted the three required materials for qualification (video, participation intent, (E)TDP). This starts the single-blind peer-review phase: Each team is assigned three (E)TDPs and is tasked to review them, answer basic questions about the submissions and share concerns and ideas for improvement with the team and/or the TC/OC.
To keep the review single-blind, please avoid self-identifying yourself or your team in the comments or shared media. The single-blind review is important to us because it allows reviewers to share their concerns or criticize the submission without fear for retaliation.Failure to meaningfully review the submissions may result in disqualification of your team!
After the TDP Peer Review Deadline but on or before the Preliminary Team Qualification Results Announcement, TC/OC will contact each team (again, by email) to announce to them one of the following four Preliminary Qualification Status:

Qualified: If the video and the (E)TDP are of sufficient quality, a team is directly qualified for the RoboCup. They are still encouraged to improve their (E)TDP by incorporating relevant feedback, but this isn’t required to participate. Teams can (in extreme cases) lose their qualified status – by prolonged failure to reply to OCs emails that are crucial for running the competition. Qualified teams can withdraw for any reason from the competition by announcing their withdrawal to the OC. Teams are encouraged to announce their withdrawal as soon as they know to allow for teams to move up from the waiting list (and to allow for a smooth organization).
On the waiting list: We have to limit the number of participants for the RoboCup. If the number of applicants is higher than our capacity, we give out slots based on initial qualification material quality (with a higher significance on (E)TDP quality), and a few slots are given out by chance. Teams who have otherwise qualified, but who haven’t managed to get a slot are on the waiting list. In their email announcing this to the team, TC/OC includes the current position on the waiting list (ranked by qualification material quality). If a qualified team withdraws, TC/OC will go through the waiting list in order and search for a replacement team. Keep an eye on your emails! If you are on the waiting list and want to withdraw, please also announce that to the OC to speed up the process.
Conditionally Qualified: If the video and/or the (E)TDP have major flaws, teams are usually conditionally qualified. In their email announcing this decision, TC/OC gives a list of conditions the team has to meet by the Final TDP Submission Deadline to be allowed to compete in the RoboCup. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.
Not qualified: In extremely rare cases (with a unanimous vote in TC/OC) a bad (E)TDP submission can result in the team being not qualified, without a second chance to improve their submission. This is only for extreme cases, and reflects that conditional qualification is a huge drain on scarce resources: While your initial (E)TDP was reviewed by three of your peers, checking your updated (E)TDP after a conditional qualification has to be done by TC/OC members. Initially submitting an (E)TDP that clearly isn’t even close to be acceptable for qualification and planning on writing a decent one only for the final (E)TDP Submission Deadline is disrespectful towards your peers who had to waste time on a review you are not interested in, and is requiring the TC/OC to do a full review of your submission themselves.

TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020– This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardwareimprovements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also thereasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for otherteams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier forreviewers to read it. It also has no (self-)plagiarism.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper– This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planningsystem. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significantchanges in that area, and mentioning them would only mean havingduplicate information. The paper is also notexcessively long.
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020– This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, themechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It isa bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers eachtopic well and it has no (self-)plagiarism.
 
Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time.As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could resultsignificantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. Thequalification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old.If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams toprove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If yourvideo is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match,teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (seelisting below). The qualification video can be either of the followingtypes, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game(i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). Thevideo should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. Forparticipating in Division A, teams also have to show their ballplacement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a teamto compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams inthe qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2025 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in amodern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

CONTENT:
Organizing the RoboCup requires a lot more than knowing the rules. The SSL committee maintains a requirements document with all the details that make up a full fledged tournament. It is used to make sure that the local organizers set up the venue to the leagues needs.

As this document can also be very valuable for teams to organize their own tournaments or to set up their own home fields, we will publish the requirements document of each RoboCup starting with 2022.

Requirements for RoboCup SSL 2022

Requirements for RoboCup SSL 2023

Requirements for RoboCup SSL 2024

Requirements for RoboCup SSL 2025
In addition to the normal requirements document we also had a network requirements document until 2024, since the team responsible to setup the networking infrastructure at the RoboCup and the venue organization / the contractor to build the field are usually different. Also the networking requirements have their own complexity for why it was separated from the main document. Since there were significant changes in the network requirements from 2025 on and the responsibility for the various network areas were changed, both documents were reunited again.

AutoRef Challenge

Goal of the Technical Challenge
This document is intended to describe the requirements of AutoRef software. The goal of this software is to help the human referee by automating decisions.

The Technical Challenge is conducted entirely before RoboCup 2016. 
Extended deadline for the AutoRef version that will be evaluated: March 14th 2016 (old deadline: Feb 28th 2016)

Setup and Requirements
The Autoref receives vision packets and sends its decisions to the traditional SSL Refbox which forwards
these referee commands to the actual game.
Both programs run on the same computer and communicate via network sockets.

The Refbox listens on Port 10007 for TCP connections communicating in the Refbox remote control format. 
The goal is to provide software that:

 detects as many infringements as possible (Alertness) minimize the number of false decisions (Accuracy) detects as many different infringements as possible (Completeness) subordinates to any decision a human makes on the Refbox is able to send commands for AutoPlacement has the ability to log a game in order to evaluate decisions is able to run on Ubuntu 14.04, with clear build instructions.
Evaluation
Subsequently,
 the submitted software will be tested. Every team is encouraged to 
conduct the tests and share their results. Ideally, a video of the tests
 is provided.

 A correctly detected rule infringement adds 1 point to the score of this Technical Challenge.  Every infringement will be tested multiple times according to the maximum number of points that is stated below. Wrong detection will subtract 2 points. Negative points in single infringements are possible.  The total points are the sum of all points. If the sum is negative,
 the result is treated as 0 points in this Technical Challenge.  The points will be normalized by the maximum number of points, which is 50. A team with 38 points will receive a 76% rating for this Technical challenge.
 Law 3: Number of Players (2) Law 12: Pushing / Substantial Contact (2) Law 12: Multiple Defender (2) Law 12: Attacker in Defense Area (2) Law 12: Icing / Kicking over midline and opponent goal line (2) Law 12: Ball Speed (2) Law 12: Robot Speed during Stop (2) Law 12: Maximum Dribbling Distance (2) Law 12: Touching the opponent goalkeeper (2) Law 12: Double Touch (2) Law 15: Throw-in (2) Law 16: Goal Kick (2) Law 17: Corner Kick (2) Law 13 – 17: Attacker not too close to the opponent’s penalty area when ball enters play (2) Law 13 – 17: Keeping the correct distance during opponent’s freekicks (2) Correct forwarding of commands to RefBox (10) Correct AutoPlacement commands (10)
Submission
So far, the following AutoRef software has been submitted: CMDragons ER-Force Tigers Mannheim 

Autonomous Ball Placement

Goal of the Technical Challenge
The
 intention of this feature is to minimize the time needed to restart the
 game. This is achieved by placing the ball autonomously by robots (“AutoPlacement“).

The Technical Challenge is conducted on Thursday, after the games. 

Procedure
AutoPlacement commands are issued by the AutoRef software. They are forwarded by the Refbox as game states BallPlacementYellow or BallPlacementBlue and include the requested ball position. Before and after those commands the game is in Stop state.
AutoPlacement may be requested before any referee decision, e.g. before kickoffs, direct or indirect freekicks, or penalties.

During ball placement the same rules apply as in Stop state. The only exception is that robots of one team are allowed to approach the ball, according to the team that is mentioned in the BallPlacement state.

The ball is considered placed successfully if the following conditions apply:

 no more than 15 seconds passed since the placement command there is no robot within 50cm distance to the ball the ball is stationary the ball is at a position within 10cm radius from the requested position
This means that the robot has to move away from the ball once the team considers the ball placed correctly.

In the case of failure, the AutoRef will command the other team 
to place the ball. The team that receives the ball after the placement 
remains the same. 
If both teams fail to place the ball, Stop will be sent and the ball is 
placed by the human referee.

If a team has not implemented ball placement or fails AutoPlacement the third time in a half game,
 AutoPlacement is disabled for this team in the AutoRef software. In 
this case, the other team will receive the AutoPlacement request. If 
AutoPlacement is disable for both teams, the human ref places the ball 
at all times.

If the ball left the field surroundings (e.g. after a chip kick) or is not visible, the ball is always placed by the human ref.

Evaluation
The TC reserves the right to change the evaluation procedure.

Every team places the ball in the same situations. The number and
 kind of situations will be determined by the TC. The command will be 
issued and the teams have to place the ball in 15 seconds and move away 
from the ball. 

A point will be awarded for every successfully placed ball. The  points will be normalized and merged with the 11 vs. 11 Technical  challenge. 

11v11 Mixed Team Challenge

The 11 on 11 Technical challenge is a full match between two teams of
 up to 11 robots, each composed of robots from two different SSL teams 
(here referred to as sub-teams). Each robot must be controlled by its 
originating sub-team’s software. Sub-team pairings will rotate so that 
each team plays with all possible partner teams.

Communication
Communication between the two sub-teams of a team is allowed, according to the following specifications:

 Messages are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf to port 10012. Sub-teams communicate only a rough plan for each of their robots using the TeamPlan message specified by the multi_team_communication.proto Google protobuf:
 package multi_team_comm;
 //Protocol to communicate rough plans to other teammates
 //Units are specified as follows:
 //length - millimeters
 //time - seconds
 //angle - radians
 
 //Plan of a list of robots
 message TeamPlan {
   repeated RobotPlan plans = 1;
 }
 
 //Plan of a single robot
 message RobotPlan {
   //ID of the robot from SSL vision
   required uint32 robot_id = 1;
   //Role that this robot is assuming
   // 0 - no specified role
   // 1 - goalie
   // 2 - defense
   // 3 - offense
   optional int32 role = 2;
   //Planned navigation target
   optional Pose nav_target = 3;
   //Planned shot target
   optional Location shot_target = 4;
 }
 
 // Location message, in mm. The center of the field is specified as (0, 0).
 // Positive x axis points to the opponent's goal
 message Location {
   required int32 x = 1;
   required int32 y = 2;
 }
 
 message Pose {
   //location of the robot
   optional Location loc = 1;
   //heading of the robot
   optional float heading = 2;
 };

Rules
Standard SSL rules apply to mixed team games with the following additions:

 A mixed team is formed from robots of two sub-teams. The maximum robot number is increased to 11 per mixed team. Each 
sub-team may have only a maximum of 5 players on the field at any time. 
Each sub-team may additionally provide a goalkeeper for one period. The 
goal keeper for the second period must not be provided by the same 
sub-team that provided the goalkeeper for the first period. Goals are only valid if robots from both of the two sub-teams 
forming a mixed team have touched the ball since the last stoppage of 
play. The robots must be able to submit to a speed limit imposed by the 
referee, subject to change during the game due to safety concerns. Teams
 will be allowed to touch their computers for up to a minute if the 
speed limit is changed; this time will be used exclusively to change the
 speed configuration as requested.
Field Setup
The size of the field will be approximately 13.4 meters by 9 meters, as shown below.

For the quad-size field setup, a total of eight cameras will be used, with two
separate computers running ssl-vision. 
The coordinate system, and camera layout will be as shown in the following
figure:

Computer 0 will run process images from cameras 0-3, and computer 1 will process images from cameras 4-7. On ssl-vision on computer 0, cameras 4-7 will be enumerated, but not running. On ssl-vision on computer 1, cameras 0-3 will be enumerated, but not running. Both computers will publish their data to the standard ssl-vision UDP multicast and port, 224.5.23.2:10006 
The quad-size-field branch of SSL-Vision has been pre-configured to the coordinate system and camera assignment for the quad-size field.

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2013.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committes encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Until May 31st, teams interested in participating in any of the challenges need to announce their interest to the Organizing Committee . This is necessary for the preparation of the schedules. Please state in which challenges your team is planning to participate.
Shooting Challenge
This challenge will test the team’s shooting accuracy and ability to score a goal against four slowly moving defenders and one goal keeper. The task is to score from seven fixed positions in the field of play as depicted in the image below. The aim of this challenge is to score as many goals as possible.
Each team is allowed to have a single robot on the field of play during the challenge.The exact ball positions might be subject of change.The balls are placed one by one by the referee.For each ball position a “direct freekick” command is issued by the referee box. After the shot has been completed a “stop” signal will be sent and the next ball is placed.During ball placement a “halt” signal might be sent due to vision interference. Robots need to adhere to the “halt” signal and stop moving.The standard rules for the execution of a direct freekick apply, e.g., no double touch and lack of progress. During stop mode the robot needs to keep distance.Four defenders will move slowly along the outside of the defense area. The goal keeper will move slowly between the goal posts.Own goals by the slowly moving defenders or goalie are not counted.It is not allowed to interfere with the defenders or goal keeper. If the attacker contacts any of the defenders or the goal keeper, the number of goals is reduced by one.
Each team will have a single turn. Each ball position will be used twice. Therefore, a maximum of 14 goals can be achieved.
Each team is allowed to cancel the turn and restart the challenge once. The turn may be cancelled only before the last shot has been taken.
Navigation Challenge
Three robots have to navigate through a dozen of static obstacles from the left side of the field to the right side of the field, while crossing the center point of the field. The obstacles are randomly distributed in the center of the field. The goal is to reach the target positions as fast as possible.
Obstacles are randomly scattered in a virtual circle around the center of the field of play. It will be ensured that at least one path with the width of at least two robot diameters will exist through the obstacles to the center of the field from each side of the field. Examples of possible routes are depicted in the image below as lines with arrows. It does not matter which particular robot fills each target position.Teams will not be allowed to test with the final obstacle configuration before the technical challenge.Each team needs to have three robots navigating through the field, placed in each corner (corner kick position) and the penalty point as shown in the image below. Blue points are starting positions and yellow points are targets.All robots have to reach the center of field (indicated in violet in the image below) before reaching their target, such that a successful pass is recorded. If a robot moves to the target position without reaching the center of the field, a successful pass is not counted until the robot moves to the center of the field first and then moves back to its target position.Each collision with an obstacle will result in a time penalty of 5 seconds.Each collision with another robot will result in a time penalty of 7 seconds.Pushing or substantially dislocating an obstacle will result in a time penalty of 10 seconds.To begin the challenge a “force start” signal will be sent from the referee box and the clock is started.The clock will be stopped once the last robot as reached its final target and stopped moving. It is understood that the target position and center point might not be reached exactly due to vision noise. An error of 5cm is considered to be sufficient for this challenge.
Each team has two tries, and the best time is recorded as the final result.

RoboCup 2020/2021

Due to the circumstances in January 2021, RoboCup 2021 will be a fully virtual / decentralized event. All teams, even already qualified teams via the Qualification for RoboCup 2020 are advised to read the following point carefully.
Evey team intending on participating in RoboCup 2021 has to sent a participation intent. The details can be found under Qualification Criteria.The RoboCup 2021 will be consistent of two parts: A simulation based tournament, and a collection of four robot-based decentralized activities. To participate in the robot-based tournament, you need to have access to a field of at least 4x3m. The detailed rules for the robot-based tournament are still being drafted.There will not be different divisions in 2021. The robot-based tournament does not play normal matches, so divisions are not relevant there. In the virtual tournament, both teams have to agree on the used rules for each match. If no agreement is reached, the rules default to Division B.Due to the unusual circumstances regarding the qualification for Robocup 2021, the organizing committee might ask some more experienced teams to review some of the newly submitted TDPs, even if the reviewer are already qualified for the event.

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by 16th of February 2021: 
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video (see instructions below).
In addition, every team that intents on participating in the Robocup 2021 has to sent an participation intent, even if they were already qualified for the previous competition. A participation intent is an email to the organizing committee. The email subject should be 2021 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include: 
Team NameCountryUniversityMain contact name and emailWebsite (if you have one)Tournament you wish to participate in (simulation, robot based or both)
Please pay attention to the following points:
All teams qualified for Robocup 2020 are automatically qualified and do not have to submit a Team Description Paper or a Team Video.Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every division B team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) and every division A team an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2020.
To create an account, click on “Register”, next to the “New to CMT?” text. To submit a paper, click on the top left button “Create a new submission”.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review other teams, and every team will receive three reviews for their (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage and be under 2 minutes long. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):
A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup game or one of the local regional competitions. The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill.A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Teams have been asking us if they could show a video of a simulation due to current COVID restrictions. We want to make clear that teams need to have real working robots to participate in the SSL for 2021. If teams cannot satisfy the requirements for the team video, they can use a simulation, but it has to be video of your robots participating in a (simulated) match (item 1 in the list). Additionally, teams should show to the best of their capabilities that they do have real working robots. 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2023
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2023 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

CONTENT:
In 2010, we have two technical challenges. These two challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop interesting technical contributions. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge are more likely to benefit from their work. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed from their respective 2009 versions. All challenges must use the new SSL Shared Vision system and the new standard robot pattern.
Until June 4th (two weeks before the start of the competition), each team that is interested in participating in the challenge has to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.
Mixed Team Challenge – Shooting and Passing
One of the aims of the Small Size League is to foster the development of cooperating agents. The current state of the art is to control all members of one team by a central intelligence instance which has a complete knowledge about the current state of each robot. Even in teams which have a distributed artificial intelligence component, every robot has detailed information about the behaviours of its team members and thus can deduce actions which lead to an overall cooperative behaviour of the whole team. The aim of this challenge is to define a scenario for “real” cooperation, i.e. to let robots cooperate which do not have any knowledge about the internal state of all other robots of their team. This is intended to become realized by mixing existing teams.
A mixed team is defined:
For the 2010 challenge, we consider a mixed team as a team of four robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each of these two sub-teams has to provide two robots. Each sub-team controls their robots with their own software stack. Of course, all members of a mixed team have the same team marker colour. For this year, there will not be any communication between the different sub-teams. A mixed team must use the new SSL Shared Vision system and the new standard robot pattern.
For creating the mixed teams, the following approach will be applied:
After the round robin stage of the soccer competition (i.e. on Tuesday afternoon), the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” are separated into two groups. In both groups, every team has to pair with every other team and perform the challenge task. The two best teams from each group will process to the final round according to their score. These teams have to pair with every other team and perform the challenge task again. The total ranking of the challenge can be determined as follows:
The first four teams are ranked by only the number of goals they scored in the final round.The remaining teams are ranked by the number of goals their scored.
The Challenge
Put up two robots from each different teams on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after two robots from different teams have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass*)2 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes*)
*A pass will only be considering as valid if it has involved robots originating from two different teams.
The rules for this challenge:
To start, the mixed team chooses a side of the field. All robots must be placed within 1m from their team’s goal line. Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles. A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the mixed team’s own side of the field. A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half. Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
To start, all robots must be placed within 1m from the own goal line.Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles.A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the own side of the field.A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half.Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
Open Challenge
This challenge is designed to encourage creativity within the Small-Size League, allowing teams to demonstrate interesting research on autonomous mobile robot systems. Each team will demonstrate their research on a standard Small Size League 2010 field, and has to use one or more Small Size League robot(s) as part of the demonstration. In this open challenge, hardware modifications or extensions to the small size robot(s) are acceptable, even if not fully compliant to the standard SSL game rules, as long as the demonstration poses no risk to the people, the field, or the equipment. Teams may use the SSL-Vision system that is provided. Teams are not allowed to mount any additional equipment to the overhead camera bar. Teams can demonstrate their open challenge topics as much as they like within three minute. Each team may also distribute a short presentation or a page of a paper to describe their research. The winner will be decided by a vote from SSL team leaders using a Barda count. Each team will list their top 10 teams in order (excluding themselves). The teams are encouraged to evaluate the performance based on these criteria: Technical strength, novelty, expected impact, and relevance to the league. The time of vote will be within 30 minutes after the last demonstration. Each ranking from each team is converted to points: 10 points for top ranking, 9 points for second, down to 1 point for 10th. Any points awarded by a team to itself will be disregarded. The points awarded by the teams are summed. The team with the highest total score will be the winner of this challenge.
Overall Challenge Ranking
The results from two challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let MIXED_1_SUM be the sum of all points in a group that all teams in a group received in the first round of the mixed team challenge, MIX_2_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the final round of the mixed team challenge, MIXED_1_TEAM be the number of points a single team received in the first round and MIXED_2_TEAM be the number of points a single team received in the final round.
Let OPEN_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in open challenge and OPEN_TEAM be the number of points a single team received.
Then
TOTAL_TEAM = ( (MIXED_1_TEAM / MIXED_1_SUM) + (MIX_2_TEAM / MIXED_2_SUM) )/2 + OPEN_TEAM / OPEN_SUM
Time and Fields
The challenge will be conducted during the first and second days in the competition.
Optional Game Demo
If some teams volunteer to show a mixed full 5 vs. 5 SSL soccer match, we would strongly appreciate and support this. Nevertheless, this will not be considered for the overall challenge ranking.

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by February 1st, 2022:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2022 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.
The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
The TDP should be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
We have to set up a conference management system to handle this year’s peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2022.
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2022 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-pennyconcept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our publications on the last year:
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages:C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
The source code and the interface are all in Brazilian Portuguese idiom, so it might be difficult to use it for non-Portuguese speakers. Nevertheless, we are planning to add an English translation to the software; that way, the GUI could be used in both, English and Portuguese languages.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages:C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
Other additional functionalities like, download the Match League Log Files directly from the software and the use of predefined shortcuts provides an easy environment for the user watch Small Size League matches recorded or in real time.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and evaluates this move in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end, a file is generated with the results. We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.

RoboCup 2020/2021

Due to the circumstances in January 2021, RoboCup 2021 will be a fully virtual / decentralized event. All teams, even already qualified teams via the Qualification for RoboCup 2020 are advised to read the following point carefully.
Evey team intending on participating in RoboCup 2021 has to sent a participation intent. The details can be found under Qualification Criteria.The RoboCup 2021 will be consistent of two parts: A simulation based tournament, and a collection of four robot-based decentralized activities. To participate in the robot-based tournament, you need to have access to a field of at least 4x3m. The detailed rules for the robot-based tournament are still being drafted.There will not be different divisions in 2021. The robot-based tournament does not play normal matches, so divisions are not relevant there. In the virtual tournament, both teams have to agree on the used rules for each match. If no agreement is reached, the rules default to Division B.Due to the unusual circumstances regarding the qualification for Robocup 2021, the organizing committee might ask some more experienced teams to review some of the newly submitted TDPs, even if the reviewer are already qualified for the event.

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by 16th of February 2021: 
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video (see instructions below).
In addition, every team that intents on participating in the Robocup 2021 has to sent an participation intent, even if they were already qualified for the previous competition. A participation intent is an email to the organizing committee. The email subject should be 2021 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

CONTENT:
At RoboCup 2021 there will be a virtual tournament without any hardware involved. It will be played with the latest rule set, except that division A and division B teams will play in the same tournament. If one of the playing teams wishes to play with division B rules, the match will be played with division B rules.
The infrastructure for this tournament will be provided by the RoboCup organizers. Teams are expected to run their software on a Linux system, likely minimal Ubuntu 20.04 inside a custom Docker container.
The setup and configuration for the competition is available on Github, so every team can test it beforehand.
The tournament is hosted at https://virtual.ssl.robocup.org/
Procedure
The primary referee will control the game and should start preparing the next match at least 5 min before the scheduled start time. If the primary refereeing team does not show up 5 minutes before the scheduled start time, the secondary refereeing team will take over the role of the primary referee and the GC operator.
If a team does not show up within 10 minutes after the scheduled starting time or if one team forfeits, the other team will play on an empty goal in the group stage and will automatically win in the elimination stage.
Before each match
Initialize the game-controller
Start a new game.Enter the correct team names.Make sure that both autoRefs are connected.Make sure that all game events for both autoRefs are set to Accept.Make sure that all game events for GC are set to Majority.
Retrieve information from both teams
The Match Preparation from the rules apply, expect for the following differences:
Determine one main contact person per team (which takes the role of the robot handler and is the only one allowed to talk with the referee)Ask teams if both agree to play with DivA rules, else switch to DivB in GC.Determine team colors (like described in the rules)Determine which team will have the first kickoff (by flipping a (virtual) coin) and enter it into the GC.Ask teams for their initial keeper ids and set the id in the GC.
Start the game at the scheduled start time or soon after, when all teams are ready
Ask if teams are ready.Hit STOP in the GC.The match should automatically start with a kickoff as soon as all robots are at valid positions.
After the match
Make sure that the game is switched to the “end of game” stage at the top. This will stop the automatic recording.Submit the results to https://scheduling.virtual.ssl.robocup.org/results.

Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-pennyconcept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our publications on the last year:
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages:C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
The source code and the interface are all in Brazilian Portuguese idiom, so it might be difficult to use it for non-Portuguese speakers. Nevertheless, we are planning to add an English translation to the software; that way, the GUI could be used in both, English and Portuguese languages.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages:C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
Other additional functionalities like, download the Match League Log Files directly from the software and the use of predefined shortcuts provides an easy environment for the user watch Small Size League matches recorded or in real time.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and evaluates this move in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end, a file is generated with the results. We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.

CONTENT:
A key distinguishing characteristic of the Small Size League is its tight integration of software and hardware, which is crucial to success. A purely simulated tournament may reflect the best in software, but it excludes hardware development and omits hardware-software integration. To address this gap, the SSL hardware challenges will be conducted alongside the virtual SSL soccer tournament for RoboCup 2021. The rules for the SSL Hardware Challenges require significantly fewer resources than a full-size SSL field setup, and takes into account the constraints identified by the SSL teams.
The rules of the hardware challenges are available in both HTML format optimized for viewing on electronic devices and as a PDF for printing:

Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.
The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
The TDP should be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
We have to set up a conference management system to handle this year’s peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2022.
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2022 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Dear SSL community,
as in past years, we are happy to submit our entry for the Open SourceAward.
You will find a list of our publications below.
Framework + Simulator:
This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI. It is able to– receive and process real life vision data– simulate SSL games– control robots– create game recordings and play them back…and much more.
New features since last years RoboCup include:– A new dribbling filter– Basic Git integration (i.e. show the Commit the binary is built from)Git integration into our log format will be released soon afterRoboCup– Various bug fixes and small features
The repository also contains our simulator, bundled as a standaloneexecutable for usage in this years RoboCup.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework
Autoref
This is our automatic referee, that detects the various ruleinfringements teams can commit during a SSL game.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/autoref
In case you have questions about our software or are just curious, feelwelcome to write an email to info@robotics-erlangen.de
Best regardsPaul BergmannER-Force
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL-Community,
For the first year since competing RoboTeam Twente is ready to enter for the Open Source Award. As all of our team members change (almost) in full every year we strive to have detailed and easy to understand documentation for everyone. This means that apart from all our designs we have collected all our recent how-to’s, design decisions and detailed explanations into a wiki. This wiki we also use to introduce new people to our team, so we hope it can be especially helpful for newer teams and those who are looking into tips for building enough robots to transition to division A.
Our wiki can be found here: https://wiki.roboteamtwente.nl/
Although the wiki also describes all previously made design in terms of hardware and software, some highlights of the changes we made this year include:
– Transitioning to a modular design with hardware and electronics combined for faster repair and more extensive testing. (rationale)- A fully renewed Front Assembly, which contains our dribbler and a new dampening mechanism. (design | rationale)– Custom made space-saving solenoids for kicking and chipping which freed up quite some space in our robots. (design | rationale)– Newly designed path planning based on bang-bang trajectories. (rationale)
We hope this can help other teams in their process of improving the SSL robots. If you have any questions we are more than happy to answer them, and if you find it useful we would love to hear that from you. We look forward to seeing you all at the RoboCup!
Kind regards,
Anne van Harten | RoboTeam Twente

Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-penny concept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community that have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our repositories.
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages: C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
To improve the quality and usefulness of our open-source material we’ve started slowly changing our code base from portuguese to english. Although it demands a great effort to translate all the previous code, we believe that this should greatly improve the accessibility of our code base to the league.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages: C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and it in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end of the game, the software generates the information of all moves occurred on the match.
We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. By now there is a one-stop shop to get it all:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, and our full AI. Here is a briefdescription of what has changed.
Mechanics:The kicker and dribbler have been slightly updated to be more robust.The dribbler now allows prolonged periods of dribbling with highertorque. The release includes the full robot mechanics.
Firmware:The build system has been changed to CMake and the folder structure hasbeen reorganized. The dribbler control algorithm now allows bettercurrent and speed control. Test and model identification methods havebeen cleaned up and improved. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Watch out for some serious dribbling moveswhich will make you sweat 😉
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim

1. League Overview

1.1. Committees

The Small Size League (like every other league of the RoboCup) is run by close cooperation of three different committees (executive committee, technical committee and organizing committee), all with a different set of responsibilities. The members of the respective committees can be found on the official RoboCup Small Size League website (https://ssl.robocup.org).

In practice, there is no strict separation between the technical and the organizing committee. Members of both committees often work together on the joint set of tasks.

Additionally, the members of the local organizing committee organize the RoboCup event for all leagues.

1.1.1. Executive Committee

Executive committee members are responsible for the long term goals of the Small Size League and thus have also contact to other leagues as well as to the RoboCup federation. The executive committee presents the Small Size League and its achievements to the RoboCup federation every year and gets feedback to organize the league. Executive committee members are elected by the board of trustees of the RoboCup federation. They serve 3-year terms.

1.1.2. Technical Committee

The technical committee of the Small Size League is responsible for the technical aspects of the RoboCup, such as maintaining the rules and the shared software. All members are elected by the team leaders of the teams which have participated in the previous competition.

1.1.3. Organizing Committee

The organizing committee of the Small Size League is responsible for preparing and organizing the competition. This mainly includes making the schedule, performing the qualification process, and running the competition. The committee members are selected by the executive committee of the league and the RoboCup trustees.

1.1.4. Local Organizing Committee

The local organizing committee is responsible for planning and executing the event itself in accordance with the needs of the different leagues. This includes setting up the team areas (fields, network, tables, whiteboard, screens, etc.), creating a schedule for the event and implementing a safety and security concept.

1.2. Divisions

The Small Size League is divided into two divisions with separate tournaments, namely division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions.

When submitting the qualification material, the team also chooses a preferred division including a short rationale. The members of the organizing committee will have the final word. Information about the qualification process can be found on the official RoboCup Small Size League website (https://ssl.robocup.org).

A summary of differences between the two divisions can be found in the Appendix.

Divisions allow for more radical advancements in the Small Size League without drastically raising the entry barrier for new teams. Additionally, they also considerably increase the amount of matches between teams of similar skill.

2. Playing Environment

2.1. Field Setup

2.1.1. Dimensions

The field of play must be rectangular and of the following size:

Division A: 13.4 meters times 10.4 meters with a playing area of 12 meters times 9 meters

Division B: 10.4 meters times 7.4 meters with a playing area of 9 meters times 6 meters

The exact field dimensions and the field markings at the venue may vary by up to ±10% in each linear dimension.

The two figures below show the dimensions of the field, the goals and special field areas, measured in millimeters between the line centers.  Figure 1 shows the dimensions for division A and  figure 2 for division B.

The numbers in the figures below show the distances in millimeters between the line centers.

Figure 1. Field dimensions and markings for division A

Figure 2. Field dimensions and markings for division B

2.1.2. Field Surface

The playing surface is green felt mat or carpet. The floor under the carpet is level, flat, and hard.

The field surface will continue for 0.7 meters beyond the field lines on all sides. The outer 0.4 meters of this runoff area, separated from the robot area by a 0.1 meters tall black wall, is used as a designated walking area for the referee and the assistant referee. The remaining 0.3 meters are the field margins.

2.1.3. Field Markings

The field of play is marked with lines. All lines are 0.01 meters wide and white (paint, spray, white carpet or strong tape). Lines belong to the areas of which they are boundaries.
Distances between lines are measured from their centers.
Distances from a robot are measured from its nearest side to the respective measurement point, with an assumed radius of 0.09 m.

Field Lines

The playing area is defined by four field lines. The two longer field lines are called touch lines. The two shorter field lines are called goal lines.

Halfway Line

The field of play is divided into two halves by a halfway line that runs along the width of the field and through the center of the field.
The  halfway line is parallel to the goal lines.

Goal-to-Goal Line

The goal-to-goal line runs along the length of the field, passing through the center of the goals and the field. The goal-to-goal line is parallel to the touch lines.

This line is used to provide adequate features for the geometry calibration of the vision software and for optional local localisation of robots.

Center Circle

The center circle is located at the center of the field with a diameter of 1 meter.
The center is at the crossing of the halfway line and the goal-to-goal line.

Defense Area

A defense area is defined as a rectangle touching the goal lines centrally in front of both goals. The size of the defense area is 3.6 meters times 1.8 meters for division A and 2 meters times 1 meter for division B, as shown in figures 1 and 2 respectively.

Penalty Mark

The penalty mark defines the point from which a team executes a penalty kick against the opponent goal. It is located on the goal-to-goal line and 8 meters (division A) or 6 meters (division B) away from the opponent’s goal center.

2.1.4. Goals

Goals must be placed on the center of each goal line and anchored securely to the field surface. They consist of two 0.16 meters high vertical side walls joined at the back by a 0.16 meters high vertical rear wall. The inner face of the goal has to be covered with an energy absorbing material such as foam to help absorb ball impacts and lessen the speed of deflections. The inner goal walls are white, the outer goal walls, edges, and tops are black.

The distance between the side walls is 1.8 meters for division A and 1 meter for division B, and the goal is 0.18 meters deep. The goal walls are 0.02 meters thick and touch the goal line, but do not overlap or encroach on the field lines or the field. Figure 3 and figure 4 show these details for division A and division B respectively.

The numbers in the figures below show the distances in millimeters.

Figure 3. The goal in detail for division A

Figure 4. The goal in detail for division B

2.2. Ball

The ball is a standard orange golf ball. It weights approximately 0.046 kilograms and its diameter measures 0.043 meters.

For official matches, the organizing committee provides the ball.

2.3. Shared Software

The shared software used in the Small Size League is maintained by the technical committee, though everyone is encouraged to contribute. The technical committee members however guarantee that any changes made less than three months before the next RoboCup do not break compatibility.

2.3.1. Vision

Each field is provided with a shared central vision server and a set of shared cameras. This shared vision equipment uses the community-maintained SSL-Vision software (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-vision) to provide localization data to teams via Ethernet in a packet format that is to be announced by the shared vision system developers before the competition. Teams need to ensure that their systems are compatible with the shared vision system output and that their systems are able to handle the typical properties of real-world sensory data as provided by the shared vision system (including noise, latency, or occasional failed detections and misclassifications). The vision patterns on the top of the robots must adhere to the specifications of SSL-Vision, and must be of the standard color paper as specified in the SSL-Vision documentation.

Besides the shared vision equipment, teams are not allowed to mount their own cameras or other external sensors, unless specifically announced or permitted by the respective competition organizers.

SSL-Vision defines an additional tracker protocol that contains filtered and enriched tracking data. Messages are not published by SSL-Vision itself, but for example by some automatic referees.
It is meant to be used by the game controller and by teams that do not yet have their own sophisticated filter.

2.3.2. Game Controller

A game is controlled by the community-maintained ssl-game-controller (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-game-controller).
It is operated by the game controller operator. The software translates decisions of the referee and the automatic referee into Ethernet communication signals that are broadcast to the network. It maintains the state of the game, tracks all events and acts as a proxy between all participating parties in the game.

The game controller has a network interface for the playing teams. They can automatically change their keeper id, they can signal a robot substitution intent for the next opportunity, and they can send an advantage choice for handling game stopping after yellow cards.

2.3.3. Automatic Referee

One or more automatic referee applications can supervise a game and report offenses to the game controller.
At least one automatic referee is required per game. If more than one automatic referee is connected to the game controller, a majority vote can be applied.

New automatic referee implementations can be provided, given that the source code is open-sourced. New implementations must be announced at least three months before the competition. The technical committee decides if an implementation will be used or not.

The Game Event Table shows which game events an automatic referee implementation must be able to detect.
Individual game events can be disabled completely or in some automatic referee implementations if both teams and the technical committee agree.

2.3.4. Remote Control

A remote control for each team can optionally be provided by the tournament organizers.
It is a physical device that allows entering the following commands:

Raise a challenge flag

Request a timeout

Request robot substitution

Request emergency stop

Change the keeper id

It may also provide feedback information, like:

Number of yellow cards and when they are due

Number of robots currently allowed

Number of robots currently on the field

The remote control may only be used by the robot handler. There is always only one remote control per team, per match.

The official implementation for the league can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-remote-control.

2.4. Communication Flags

The communication flags are used to avoid gesturing and yelling with the referee during a match.
These flags are responsible for communicating various intents, such as: timeouts, emergency stops, manual robot substitution and challenges.

The referee or game controller operator has to acknowledge the communication flag.
Any gesturing and yelling will be considered unsporting behavior, punished by a red card after the first warning.

The communication flags are provided by the organizers of the competition.
A remote control software or device can be provided and replace physical flags.
Any other solution that the organizers find feasible can also be used.

3. Robots

3.1. Number Of Robots

A match is played by two teams, with each team consisting of not more than 11 robots in division A and not more than 6 robots in division B, one of which may be the keeper. Each robot must be clearly numbered according to its vision pattern so that the referee can identify it during the match. The id of the keeper must be chosen before the match starts (see Choosing Keeper Id).

An exception is made during the Division A group phase, where the number of robots is limited to 8 if at least one of the two teams prefers it.

3.2. Hardware And Software Constraints

The referee may force a team to remove a robot from the field if it does not satisfy the rules. Members of the technical committee may also check the hardware and software constraints of robots at any point of the tournament.

If a team is not able to provide at least one robot that satisfies the rules, the team is forced to forfeit.

3.2.1. Safety

A robot must not pose danger to itself, another robot, or humans. It must not damage or modify the ball or the field.

The referee has to force a team to remove a robot from the field if he considers it a potential safety threat.

3.2.2. Shape

A robot must fit inside a 0.18 meters wide and 0.15 meters high cylinder at any point in time. Additionally, the top of the robot must adhere to the standard pattern size and surface constraints.

3.2.3. Hull Color of Robots

To ensure clarity and effective identification during gameplay, the following rules apply to the coloring of robot hulls:

Bright and dark color scheme:

All robots from a team must have interchangeable hull colors: one bright and one dark.

These two colors must be the same for all robots in a team.

The color must vertically cover at least 6 cm of the robot’s maximum height.

Coverage requirements:

The robot hull must not be reflective to avoid interfering with the vision system.

The robot hull must avoid colors close to the ones used at vision pattern and ball.

Colors must adhere properly and remain durable to prevent dropping or peeling during the match. If the color cover drops, it will be penalized accordingly (see Tipping Over Or Dropping Parts).

3.2.4. Dribbling Device

Dribbling devices that actively exert spin on the ball, which keep the ball in contact with the robot are permitted under certain conditions:

The dribbling device must not elevate the ball from the ground

Another robot must be able to remove the ball from a robot with the ball.

A robot must not take full control of the ball by removing all of its degrees of freedom.

80% of the area of the ball when viewed from above has to be outside the convex hull around the robot. This limitation applies as well to all kicking devices, even if such infringement is momentary.

3.2.5. Vision Pattern

All participating teams must adhere to the given operating requirements of the shared vision system. In particular, teams are required to use a certain set of standardized colors and patterns on top of their robots.

To ensure compatibility with the standardized patterns for the shared vision system, all teams must ensure that all robots have a flat surface with sufficient space available on the top side. The color of the robot top must be black or dark grey and have a matte (non-shiny) finish to reduce glare. The standard vision pattern is guaranteed to fit within a circle with a radius of 0.085 meters that is linearly cut off on the front side of the robot to a distance of 0.055 meters from the centre, as shown in figure 5. Teams must ensure that their robot tops fully enclose this area.

Figure 5. Standard Vision Pattern Dimensions

Every robot must have one of the 16 patterns shown in figure 6. No two robots are allowed to use the same pattern.

The center dot color determines the team and is either blue or yellow (see Choosing Team Colors). The other four dot colors encode the id of the robot. To ensure that every team uses the same colors, the organizing committee provides enough colored paper at the competition.

Teams are encouraged to prefer color assignments with ids 0 to 7 because they have been experimentally found more stable, as there is no risk that the back two dots “color-bleed” into each other.

Figure 6. Standard Vision Pattern Colors

3.2.6. Radio Communication

Participants using wireless communications must notify the organizing committee of the method of wireless communication, power, and frequency. The organizing committee must be notified of any change after registration as soon as possible. In order to avoid interference, a team must be able to select from two carrier frequencies before the match. The type of wireless communication has to follow legal regulations of the country where the competition is held. Compliance with local laws is the responsibility of the competing teams, not the RoboCup Federation.

The type of wireless communication may also be restricted by the local organizing committee. The local organizing committee will announce any restrictions to the community as early as possible.

Bluetooth is not allowed since it cannot be fixed to frequency channels.

3.2.7. Autonomy

The robotic equipment has to be fully autonomous. Human operators are not permitted to enter any information to the system during a match, except in breaks or during a timeout. Additionally, robots may not be manually moved during any phase of the match, except for moving robots out of the field, or into the field as described in Robot Substitution. Disregarding this rule is considered unsporting behavior.

4. Game Structure

4.1. Impartial Roles

To play an official match in the Small Size League, four impartial roles must be filled:

the referee

the assistant referee

the game controller operator

the vision expert

Usually, these roles are filled by two non-playing teams, with one team providing the referee and the game controller operator and the other team providing the assistant referee and the vision expert. The assignment of the roles is up to the organizing committee.

Every participating team is required to be able to provide enough people who are familiar with these roles.

4.1.1. Referee

Each match is controlled by the referee. He has full authority to enforce the rules of the Small Size League in connection with the match to which he has been appointed. The referee is encouraged to use the designated walking area next to the field (see Field Setup).

The referee is assisted by the automatic referee software. The human referee is allowed to override any decision made by the automatic referee software.

The decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play are final. The referee may only change a decision on realizing that it is incorrect or, at his discretion, on the
advice of an assistant referee, provided that he has not restarted play.

The rules do not define all circumstance and their consequences in every detail.
The referee is thus advised to judge in an adequate way, if the rules are not explicit.
The usual procedure is to issue a warning on the first occurrence and an Unsporting Behavior on repetition.

The referee is not held liable for any kind of injury suffered by an official or spectator, any damage to property of any kind nor any other loss suffered by an individual, club, company, association, or other body.

The robot handler is the only team member that may talk to the referee.

Duties

The referee ensures a safe match for all humans and robots

The referee ensures a fair match according to the rules of the Small Size League

The referee ensures that there is no interference by unauthorized persons or team members

The referee or assistant referee places the ball for kick-offs and penalties (division A) or after every stoppage (division B). Subsequently, the referee resumes the match

The referee ensures that the game is started and resumed in time

4.1.2. Assistant Referee

The assistant referee supports the referee wherever he can. He is encouraged to use the designated walking area next to the field, opposite the referee.

No team members are allowed to talk to the assistant referee.

Duties

The assistant referee indicates when misconduct or any other incident has occurred out of the view of the referee

The assistant referee discusses unclear situations with the referee

The referee or assistant referee places the ball for kick-offs and penalties (division A) or after every stoppage (division B)

4.1.3. Game Controller Operator

During a match, the game controller operator uses the game controller software as an interface between the referee, the automatic referee and the team software.

No team members are allowed to talk to the game controller operator, except the robot handler for robot substitution intents.

Duties

The game controller operator configures the game controller before the game begins

The game controller operator enters the signals of the referee into the game controller

The game controller operator watches the game event log for any events that need attention, like detections of an automatic referee or elapsed timers and notifies the referee

4.1.4. Vision Expert

During a match, the vision expert is in charge of the shared vision system on the field.

Team members are generally advised not to talk to the vision expert, unless they experience major vision problems.

Duties

The vision expert checks the vision hardware and reports any kind of hardware problems to the technical committee

The vision expert monitors the shared vision system during the match and reports any kind of problems to the referee instantly

The vision expert recalibrates the vision system if the referee deems it necessary

4.2. Team-Specific Roles

4.2.1. Robot Handler

Before the start of the match, every team has to designate one robot handler. The robot handler represents the team during the match.

Duties

The robot handler helps preparing the match.

The robot handler asks the referee for timeouts if necessary.

The robot handler can substitute a robot during game play.

The robot handler asks the referee for the permission to substitute a robot in the next stoppage and, if the referee agrees, substitutes the robot.

The robot handler voices concerns of the team (for example network issues or vision problems).

4.3. Match Preparation

All people that fill a role in the match (impartial or team-specific) have to be ready at least 10 minutes before the start of the match to allow the referee to make the following preparations:

4.3.1. Game Result Sheet

The referee obtains a game result sheet from the organizing committee. After the game, the referee fills in the final score, collects the required signatures and submits the sheet to the organizing committee.

While obtaining the game result sheet, the referee can also take an official ball and referee equipment such as a whistle or red and yellow cards (if provided).

4.3.2. Testing The Network

The referee ensures that both teams receive vision data and referee commands.

4.3.3. Choosing Team Colors

The referee asks the robot handlers of the teams about their preferred team color (either blue or yellow). If the teams agree on a color assignment, the colors will be used for the entire match.

However, if both teams prefer the same color, the referee assigns the colors by chance. In this case, the teams switch the colors after the first half of the match as well as after the first half of the overtime if applicable.

4.3.4. Choosing Robot Hull Colors

Teams are encouraged to choose their preferred robot hull color (dark or bright) before the match. If both teams choose the same color, the referee assigns the colors by chance before the game starts. The selected hull color must be used throughout the game.

4.3.5. Choosing Side And Kick-Off

The referee tosses a coin with both robot handlers. The winning team chooses the goal it will attack in the first half of the match. The other team takes the kick-off to start the match.

4.3.6. Choosing Keeper Id

The referee asks both robot handlers which robot they will use as the keeper and forwards this information to the game controller operator.

The keeper id can be changed anytime during the game if the ball is either out of play or in the opponent’s field half by:

Using the game controller network interface

Asking the game controller operator to change it in the game controller. The game controller operator must not change the keeper id until the ball is at a valid position.

Teams should only ask for a change once the requirements are met. The game controller operator is responsible for complying to the rules.

If a team does not want to use a keeper, it may select the id of a robot that is not on the field.

4.4. Game Stages

4.4.1. Overview

An official match of the Small Size League consists of the following stages:

Game Stage
Duration

First Half
300 seconds of playing time

Half-Time Break
300 seconds pause

Second Half
300 seconds of playing time

If the match is an elimination match (draw is not a possible outcome) and the score is even after the regular game time, the match goes into overtime and the following game stages are added:

Game Stage
Duration

Pre-Overtime Break
300 seconds of pause

Overtime First Half
150 seconds of playing time

Overtime Half-Time Break
120 seconds of pause

Overtime Second Half
150 seconds of playing time

If the score is even after overtime has been played, the following stages are added:

Game Stage
Duration

Pre-Shoot-Out Break
120 seconds of pause

Shoot-Out
unlimited

The match timer is paused whenever no team is allowed to manipulate the ball. This includes stop, halt and the preparation states of kick-off and penalty kick. Additionally, it is paused during ball placement.

As a result, the time needed for a match is much greater than the playing time.

4.4.2. Timeouts

The robot handler has to ask the referee for a timeout. Timeouts are handled like breaks, meaning that both teams are allowed to make modifications to their software and hardware (see Autonomy).

Any robot that has been physically interacted with during a timeout must be taken out of the field. It can be brought in again, also during the same timeout, via the area outlined in Robot Substitution.

Each team is allocated 4 timeouts at the beginning of the match. A total of 300 seconds is allowed for all timeouts. Timeouts may only be taken during a game
stoppage. The time is monitored and recorded by the game controller operator.

For example, a team may take 3 timeouts of 60 seconds duration and thereafter have only one timeout of up to 120 seconds duration.

During overtime, both teams can use 2 timeouts with a total time of 150 seconds. The number of timeouts and the time not used in regular game are not added.

No timeouts are possible in the shoot-out stage.

4.4.3. Early Termination At A Score Of 10

Before the shoot-out stage, when a team manages to shoot 10 goals,
the match is automatically terminated as soon as the goal difference is greater than one and
the team with more goals is declared the winner.

During the group phase, the number of goals scored is used as tie-breaker, so the absolute number of goals matter for overall scoring.
The rule applies to all game types for simplicity.

5. Referee Commands

An overview of the referee commands and how they interact with the game state, is given in Game States.

5.1. Stopping The Game

5.1.1. Stop

Definition
When the stop command is issued, all robots have to slow down to less than 1.5 m/s. Additionally, all robots have to keep at least 0.5 meters distance to the ball and are not allowed to manipulate the ball.

If the ball moves very quickly, it is hard to always keep the required distance to the ball, especially since the speed of the robots is limited during stop. Therefore, it is sufficient if it is obvious to the referee that the robots try their best to follow the distance rule.

Usage
The stop command is used to pause the game after the ball crossed the field lines (including goals) or an offense occurred as well as to prepare the start or resumption of the game after halt, timeouts and automatic ball placement. The robot speed limit and the minimum distance to the ball allow the referee or assistant referee to place the ball safely and without interference.

5.1.2. Halt

Definition
When the halt command is issued, no robot is allowed to move or manipulate the ball.

There is a grace period of 2 seconds for the robots to brake.

Usage
The halt command allows the referee to interrupt the game immediately whenever an emergency occurs (for example when a robot gets out of control). It is
also used to recalibrate the vision software during a game if the vision expert considers it necessary and the referee agrees and for robot substitution. Additionally, the referee is free to issue the halt command at will.

The halt command is always followed up by stop.
Enough preparation time should be given to teams, before the game is continued.
The game controller will wait for up to 10 seconds after a halt command, but the game can be continued if robots are prepared already.

As a rule of thumb, the game should always be halted when humans other than the referees are entering the field.

5.2. Ball Placement

Definition
After the game was stopped, the ball must be placed on the appropriate position, depending on the event that occurred.
The automatic ball placement is the preferred way to place the ball at the designated position on the field by the robots of the teams without human interaction.
If this is not possible, the referee places the ball manually.

During manual ball placement, the game should be in stop to allow robots to prepare for game continuation.

No ball placement is required if all of the following constraints are fulfilled:

The ball is closer than 1m to the designated position.

The ball is inside the field.

The ball is at least 0.7m away from any defense area.

The ball is stationary.

In this case, the game can be continued as soon as all robots keep the required distance for stop.

A ball is considered placed successfully by the robots if

no more than 30 seconds passed since the placement command

there is no robot within 0.05 meters distance to the ball if the next command is a free kick for the placing team

there is no robot within 0.5 meters distance to the ball if the next command is a force start

the ball is stationary

the ball is at a position within 0.15 meters radius from the requested position

No further commands will be issued by the game controller until the automatic placement is complete.
The game will be continued by the game controller as soon as the ball is successfully placed, but not earlier than 2 seconds after the ball placement command has been issued.
A failed placement will result in a free kick for the opposing team.
If this team failed to place the ball as well, the ball is placed by the referee and game continues with the original command.

For each team a ball placement failure counter is incremented on each placement failure and decremented for successful placements. It can not get negative.

The non-placing team must not interfere the ball placement task.

Usage
When the ball goes out of play, the following rules decide, if automatic ball placement is applied:

The referee has to place the ball for all kickoffs and all penalty kicks

For a free kick, the team that brings the ball into play must place the ball

For a force start, a team is drawn by chance and must place the ball

The ball must be visible and must not be inside a field corner, a goal corner or behind the goal, before the ball placement starts

The referee can decide to place the ball manually at any time

The referee can decide to disable automatic ball placement for the rest of the game. TC/OC must agree with this decision

When a teams placement failure counter reached 5, it is not allowed to place the ball for the rest of the game half. All free kicks that were a result of the ball leaving the field, are awarded to the opposing team. For all other rule violations or when both teams failed to place the ball, the ball is placed by the referee

If no team can place the ball, the ball is placed by the referee or the assistant referee. Both the referee as well as the assistant referee are advised to use a so-called ball handler (a long, preferably black stick-like device) to move the ball.

The ball may still be moving when the placement command is issued.

The game commences directly after ball placement. The team receiving the ball may shoot immediately and leave the opposing team little time to arrange defensive actions if needed.

It is allowed to enter the defense area during ball placement.

Ball placement is mandatory for all teams in division A.
Teams in division B may decide, at any time before or during the game, not to place the ball for the rest of the game by talking to the referee, who in turn tells the game controller operator to disable ball placement for this team.
In this case, the team is allowed to bring the ball into play, after the ball was placed by the opposing team.
If the opposing team fails to place the ball or no team can place the ball, it is placed by the referee or the assistant referee.

5.3. Resuming The Game

After the ball has been placed, the game is resumed using one of the following commands.

5.3.1. Normal Start

Definition
For two-staged referee commands, when normal start is sent, an attacker may manipulate the ball. A match cannot be resumed directly via normal start.

Usage
Normal start is used for kick-offs and penalty kicks.

5.3.2. Kick-Off

Definition
The ball has to be placed in the center of the field by the human referee.

When the kick-off command is issued, all robots have to move to their own half of the field excluding the center circle. However, one robot of the attacking team is also allowed to be inside the whole center circle. This robot will be referred to as the kicker. No robot is allowed to touch the ball.

When the normal start command is issued, the kicker is allowed to shoot the ball. A goal may be scored directly from the kick-off.

When the ball is in play, the kicker may not touch the ball until it has been touched by another robot or the game has been stopped (see double touch). Also, the restrictions regarding the robot positions are lifted.

Usage
Both half times as well as both overtime periods (if needed) start with a kick-off. Chapter Match Preparation describes how to determine the attacking team.

Additionally, after a goal has been scored, the receiving team restarts the game with a kick-off.

5.3.3. Free Kick

Definition
The ball placement position for a free kick depends on the event that led to the free kick. This position is valid if there is at least 0.2 meters distance to all field lines and 1 meter distance to either defense area. If an event requires the ball to be placed at a position that contravenes this rule, it has to be placed at the closest valid position instead.

When the free kick command is issued, robots of the attacking team are allowed to approach the ball while robots of the defending team still have to stay at least 0.5 meters distance away from the ball (the same distance as in stop). One robot of the attacking team is allowed to shoot the ball. This robot will be referred to as the kicker. A goal may be scored directly from the free kick.

When the ball is in play, the kicker may not touch the ball until it has been touched by another robot or the game has been stopped (see double touch). Also, the restrictions regarding the robot positions are lifted.

Usage
Free kicks are used to restart the game after a foul has occurred. Additionally, goal kicks and corner kicks are mapped to free kicks.

5.3.4. Force Start

Definition
When the force start command is issued, the game is immediately resumed and both teams are allowed to approach and manipulate the ball again.

Usage
A neutral forced start is used in situations where no team is clearly in favor, such as:

the game had to be stopped without a specific reason.

both teams are at fault.

5.3.5. Penalty Kick

Definition
The procedure of a penalty kick is as follows:

The ball is placed by the human referee on the penalty mark.

When the penalty command is issued:

The defending keeper has to move to the goal line between the goal posts and keep touching the goal line.

One attacking robot is allowed to approach the ball but not allowed to touch the ball.

Throughout the penalty kick procedure, all other robots have to be 1m behind the ball such that they do not interfere the penalty kick procedure.

When the normal start command is issued, the attacker is allowed to manipulate the ball. The ball has to only move towards the opponent goal, as measured by its x coordinate in the coordinate system of SSL-Vision.

When the ball is in play, the defending keeper may move freely again.

If the ball is still in play after 10 seconds, the game is stopped.

A goal is awarded if:

the ball touches the inner surface of a goal wall or the ground of the goal of the defending team, starting from when the normal start command is issued.

the defending team commits any foul.

The game is continued with a kick-off when a goal is awarded.

A goal is not awarded if:

the ball crosses any field lines outside the goal.

the defending keeper touches the ball such that the ball speed vector changes direction by at least 90 degrees in 2D space.

the attacking team violates any rule.

the ball is still in play after 10 seconds.

The game is continued by a goal kick for the defending team when a goal is not awarded.

The restrictions defined for scoring goals, including the ball height limit of 0.15 meters, do not apply here.
Other rules like the excessive dribbling limitation for example do.

Additional time is allowed for a penalty kick to be taken at the end of each half or at the end of periods of overtime.

Usage
Penalty Kicks are used to punish unsporting behavior and multiple defenders.

5.4. Ball In And Out Of Play

When the match is stopped, the ball is considered out of play until it has been brought into play.

When the match is resumed, the ball is considered in play until the next stoppage occurs.
The match is resumed when

force start has been issued.

the ball moved at least 0.05 meters following a kick-off, free kick or penalty kick.

10 seconds passed following a kick-off.

5 seconds (Division A) or 10 seconds (Division B) passed following a free kick.

see double touch for the rationale of the 0.05 meter distance

5.5. Sanctions

5.5.1. Yellow Card

Definition
If the yellow card is shown as a result of unsporting behavior, the referee may decide to immediately halt the match. In this case, the match continues with a free kick for the other team.

Upon receipt of a yellow card, the number of robots allowed on the field for the penalized team decreases by one. If, after this decrease, the team has more robots than permitted on the field, a robot must be taken out.

A yellow card does not lead to a stop automatically. If the ball is in play, the team will have 10 seconds to automatically remove the robot. If a robot is not taken out within time, the game is stopped for manual substitution and continues with a Forced Start.
The 10 seconds can be extended indefinitely by the other team by sending an advance choice to the game controller.

This rule implies that after receiving a yellow card, the game might not be automatically stopped. However, the game will be stopped if the foul that led to the yellow card causes a game stoppage, e.g. dropping parts. Therefore, if one of those fouls occurred, the team is allowed to manually remove the robot.

No penalty will be given to the team that couldn’t get the robot out of the field in time. However, in the future there will be a penalty like this: If the robot gets manually substituted, the ball is placed on the goal-to-goal line and 1.5 meters away from the teams defense area and the opposing team gets a free kick.

A team cannot score a goal while having more than the allowed number of robots on the field.

After 120 seconds of playing time (measured by the game controller), the yellow card expires and the number of allowed robots is increased by one. The team may put a robot back in during the next opportunity.

When a team has two not yet expired yellow cards and receives another yellow card, this card will be turned into a red card instead.

Usage
Yellow cards are used to punish teams that committed multiple fouls.

Yellow cards can also be given by the referee to punish fouls or unsporting behavior.

5.5.2. Red Card

Definition
A red card behaves like a yellow card, except: It does not expire until the end of the game.

Usage
Red cards are given by the referee to punish severe fouls or unsporting behavior.

For example, serious violent contact by the robots or disrespectful behavior towards the referees can result in a red card.

5.5.3. Forced Forfeit

Definition
A Forced forfeit means that a team instantly loses the current game with a score of 0 to 10.

Usage
A team can be forced to forfeit if it is unable to play with at least one robot that satisfies the rules.

A team can only be forced to forfeit in agreement with members of the technical committee and the organizing committee.

5.5.4. Disqualification

Definition
A Disqualification means that a team immediately drops out of the tournament and places last. It will not be eligible to receive any trophies.

Usage
A team can be disqualified if members of this team don’t follow safety guidelines, rules of the venue or commit similarly severe offenses.

A team can only be disqualified in agreement with members of the technical committee and the organizing committee.

6. Ball Leaves The Field

When the ball leaves the field by fully crossing the field line, the game will be stopped, the ball will be placed and the game will be restarted depending on the position of the field line crossing as well as on the team that last touched the ball.

6.1. Touch Line Crossing

Touch lines are the long field lines at both sides of the playing field.

6.1.1. Throw-In

Definition
The ball has to be placed 0.2 meters perpendicular to the touch line where the ball crossed the touch line. Its distance to the goal lines must be at least 0.2 meters.

After the ball has been placed, a free kick is awarded to the opponent of the team that last touched the ball before it left the field.

Usage
A throw-in is used to restart the game after the ball left the field by crossing the touch line.

6.2. Goal Line Crossing

Goal lines are the short field lines at both ends of the playing field.

6.2.1. Goal Kick

Definition
The ball has to be placed 0.2 meters from the closest touch line and 1 meter from the goal line.

After the ball has been placed, a free kick is awarded to the opponent of the team that last touched the ball before it left the field.

Usage
A goal kick is used to restart the game after the ball left the field by crossing the goal line of the team that did not touch the ball last.

In division B, the aimless kick rule might apply instead.

6.2.2. Corner Kick

Definition
The ball has to be placed 0.2 meters from the closest touch line and 0.2 meters from the goal line.

After the ball has been placed, a free kick is awarded to the opponent of the team that last touched the ball before it left the field.

Usage
A corner kick is used to restart the game after the ball left the field by crossing the goal line of the team that touched the ball last.

6.2.3. Aimless Kick (Division B only)

Definition
The ball has to be placed at the position from where the ball was kicked (see the free kick rules for the exact ball position rules).

After the ball has been placed, a free kick is awarded to the opponent of the team that last touched the ball before it left the field.

Usage
A kick is aimless when after the ball touched a robot, it subsequently crossed the halfline and then its opponent’s goal line outside the goal without touching another robot.

A kick-off kick cannot be aimless, as the ball is located on the halfway line and does therefore not cross it.

7. Scoring Goals

A team scores a goal when the ball fully enters the opponent goal between the goal posts,
provided that:

The team did not exceed the allowed number of robots when the ball entered the goal.

The height of the ball did not exceed 0.15 meters after the last touch of the teams robots.

The team did not commit any non stopping foul in the last two seconds before the ball entered the goal.

"The team" refers to the scoring team that is awarded a goal, not the team that kicked the ball.
For example, an own goal is not possible while the opponent team has too many robots on the field.

During penalty kicks, more specific rules apply.

If the goal is considered invalid, the game will be continued as if the ball crossed the goal line outside the goal.

8. Offenses

8.1. No Progress In Game

If there is no progress in the game for 5 seconds (Division A) or 10 seconds (Division B) while both teams are allowed to
manipulate the ball, the game is stopped
and continued by a forced start.

8.2. Double Touch

When the ball is brought into play following a kick-off or free kick,
the kicker is not allowed to touch the ball until it has been touched by another robot or the game has been stopped.

The ball must have moved at least 0.05 meters to be considered as in play.

A double touch results in a stop followed by a free kick from the same ball position.

It is understood that the ball may be bumped by the robot multiple times over a short distance while the kick is being taken.
This is why a distance of 0.05 meters is used to decide whether a robot violates this rule or not.
Remaining in contact with the ball for more than 0.05 meters also counts as double touch, even though technically the robot only touched the ball once.

8.3. Unsporting Behavior

Unsporting behavior can lead to yellow cards, red cards, penalty kicks, a forced forfeit or a disqualification. The human referee chooses an appropriate sanction, depending on the severity of the offense.

For minor infringements, a Yellow Card is adequate,
while on more severe infringements, that gave the team an advantage, a Red Card or Penalty Kick can be issued.

For harder sanctions, the referee is advised to refer to members of the technical committee or the organizing committee.

If the referee is not sure which sanction to choose, he may confer with the assistant referee and members of the technical committee or the organizing committee.

Some examples of unsporting behavior are listed below.

8.3.1. Damaging Other Robots

It is not allowed to damage or modify robots of other teams.

8.3.2. Damaging The Field Or The Ball

It is not allowed to damage or modify the field or the ball.

8.3.3. Disrespect Procedures

Not following defined procedures repetitively, like for example:

Robot handler puts a robot on the field, while it is not allowed

Robots do not keep required distance to the ball during stop

Robots do not conform to the positioning rules during a penalty kick and need to be moved or removed manually

8.3.4. Showing Lack Of Respect

A team member must show appropriate respect to everyone involved in the game. Infringements of this rule include but are not limited to:

insulting the opponent, the referee or other persons holding an impartial role

annoying the referee or other persons holding an impartial role

not obeying the orders of the referee

8.4. Fouls

The number of fouls per team is tracked by a counter. Each foul will
increase the counter by one. Every third increase to the foul counter
causes a yellow card to be awarded.

Violations in this section and its subsections increase the foul counter if not stated otherwise.

Regardless, of the prescribed penalties in this section, if a
foul is severe or repeated, the referee can choose to immediately
issue a yellow card or in extreme cases a red card.

8.4.1. Stopping Fouls

Fouls in this section cause the game to stop and then resume
with a free kick for the opposite team from the position where the ball was
located when the foul began happening.

Robot Too Close To Opponent Defense Area

During stop and free kicks, before the ball has entered play, all robots have to keep at least 0.2 meters distance to the opponent defense area.

There is a grace period of 2 seconds for the robots to move away from the opponent defense area.

The game is immediately halted after the second such foul committed by the same team while the game is stopped or during a free kick, before the ball has entered play.

If the first foul is committed during a free kick, the game is still stopped regularly.
The grace period is restarted after the first foul of the same team.
Both fouls count towards the foul counter.
There are no individual fouls per robot.

Pushing

A robot pushes an opponent robot if both robots keep contact to the ball or to each other while the robot exerts force onto the opponent robot, such that both robots travel towards the opponent robot.

If both robots are pushing each other with similar force, no team is at fault.

Ball Holding

Robots must not surround the ball to prevent access by others.

Tipping Over Or Dropping Parts

A robot must not tip over, break or drop parts on the field that pose a potential threat to other robots.

A robot violating this rule has to be substituted.

Metal parts (screws for example) as well as larger parts generally pose a potential threat, very small non-metal parts (for example rubber subwheel rings) don’t.

Multiple Defenders

This rule does not use the standard sanctions defined for fouls.

Robots other than the keeper must maintain best-effort to fully stay outside the own defense area.
Infraction of this rule can be rated as unsporting behavior.

If a robot other than the keeper touches the ball while this robot is entirely
inside its own defense area, the game is stopped and a penalty kick is awarded to the other team. The foul counter is not
increased.

Boundary Crossing

A robot must not kick the ball over the field boundary such that the ball leaves the field.

Keeper Held Ball

The ball must not be kept in the defense area for more than
5 seconds (Division A) or 10 seconds (Division B).

Excessive Dribbling

A robot must not dribble the ball further than 1 meter, measured linearly from the ball location where the dribbling started. A robot begins dribbling when it makes contact with the ball and stops dribbling when there is an observable separation between the ball and the robot.

Dribblers can still be used to dribble large distances with the ball as long as the robot periodically loses possession, such as kicking the ball ahead of it as human soccer players often do.

8.4.2. Non Stopping Fouls

Fouls in this section do not cause a stop.
Instead, the game continues normally.

The same no stop foul cannot be triggered again until the foul
condition has stopped being violated or there has been 2 seconds since
the foul was first triggered. This is to allow teams to adjust their
robots' positions, ball speed or any other property that is causing
the violation before being penalized additional times.

Attacker Touched Ball In Opponent Defense Area

The ball must not be touched by a robot, while the robot is partially or fully inside the opponent defense area.

Ball Speed

A robot must not accelerate the ball faster than 6.5 meters per second in 3D space.

Crashing

At the moment of collision of two robots of different teams, the difference of the speed vectors of both robots is taken and projected onto the line that is defined by the position of both robots. If the length of this projection is greater than 1.5 meters per second, the faster robot committed a foul. If the absolute robot speed difference is less than 0.3 meters per second, both conduct a foul.

8.4.3. Fouls While Ball Out Of Play

Fouls in this section can only occur when the ball is out of play.

Each foul has a grace period of 2 seconds per team until it is raised again.

If multiple robots commit the same foul within 2 seconds, only the first foul counts.

If a robot keeps committing a foul, it will be punished again after the grace period.

Defender Too Close To Ball

A robot’s distance to the ball must be at least 0.5 meters during an opponent kick-off or free kick.
When the foul is committed, the timer of the opponent team for bringing the ball into play is reset.

The human referee may decide to repeat the kick-off or free kick on significant disturbances.

During stop, there is no automatic sanction for being too close to the ball. The referee may still punish a team for unsporting behavior by issuing a yellow card if it does not respect the required distance. See stop for further explanation.

Robot Stop Speed

A robot must not move faster than 1.5 meters per second during stop. A violation of this rule is only counted once per robot and stoppage.

There is a grace period of 2 seconds for the robots to slow down.

This rule does not apply to ball placement.

Since the stop command is used for manual ball placement and
robot substitution, the intention of the robot
speed limit is to avoid robots harming the people on the field.

Ball Placement Interference

During ball placement, all robots of the non-placing team have to keep at least 0.5 meters distance to the line between the ball and the placement position (the forbidden area forms a stadium shape).

If a robot of the non-placing team is too close to the line between
the ball and the placement position for more than 2 seconds, it
commits a foul. In this case, 10 seconds are added to the ball
placement timer.
Only one interference foul per ball placement phase counts towards the foul counter, but the placement timer is always incremented.

This rule does not cover all cases of ball placement interference.
The referee is encouraged to call fouls if the non-placing team is obviously interfering with the ball placement.

If a robot keeps interfering the ball placement (for example if it is stuck or can not move), the human referee is encouraged to stop the placement and place the ball manually.

Excessive Robot Substitutions

If a team has used up their free robot substitution budget, every additional robot substitution is a foul.
The match is resumed with a corner kick for the opponent team.
If both teams committed this foul in the same stop, the match is resumed with the original command.

9. Robot Substitution

Definition
Robots are substituted by the robot handler of the respective team. No other team member is allowed to take robots out or put robots in.

The robot handler should prefer to use long sleeves and colors that won’t interfere with the vision system.

Robots can always be taken in and out during game play without notifying the referee if all the following conditions are met:

The robot is at least partially inside the field margin.

The robot is at a distance from the halfway line that must not exceed 1 meter.

The ball must be at least 0.5 meters away from the robot.

Additionally, robots can be taken out from any position on request using the procedure below:

The robot handler requests robot substitution at any time.

The game controller will halt the game at the next opportunity.

The robot handler may enter the field and touch robots now.

The robot handler takes robots out.

The robot handler informs the referee when done.

When both teams finished the robot substitution, the referee informs the game controller operator.

The game controller operator performs a stop followed by continuing the game.

The maximum allowed number of robots of the team on the field must not be exceeded at any time when putting robots in.

Usage
Robots can be substituted for any reason.
A substitution grants the team 20 seconds to take robots out. After that time, a new substitution is started.
Each team has 5 free substitutions per halftime.
Every additional substitution will result in an excessive robot substitutions foul for the team.

A robot substitution intent can be made by:

A robot handler by informing the game controller operator who in turn enters the intent into the game controller.

A robot handler by using the remote control, if provided.

A team software by sending a request to the game controller.

The game controller itself if a team exceeds the maximum number of robots (for example after a team receives a yellow or red card).

If the game was halted due to a substitution intent by a team, at least one robot must be taken out by this team. A substitution intent can be revoked unless the game was not already halted for substitution.

If a robot substitution intent for either team is present just before the game would continue after ball placement, the game controller automatically halts the game.

10. Shoot-Out

Definition
Both teams alternately attempt to score a goal with a penalty kick until each team has performed 5 attempts.
If both teams have the same score after those 5 attempts, each team takes another attempt in the same order as before until the score of the two teams is different.

Only up to one attacking robot and one keeper is allowed per team.
During a shoot-out attempt, the attacking robot and the opponent keeper are the only ones allowed to move and manipulate the ball.
Other robots are not allowed to interfere.

If a team is clearly not able to prepare for a penalty kick, a goal is automatically awarded to the opposing team.

Robots may be substituted between shoot-out attempts.
The new robot may be put in right away.

Note that timeouts are not allowed during shoot-out.

If there is no clear progress in determining a winner
(after 10 shoot-outs, if both teams time out doing shoot-outs, or if both teams cannot prepare and execute the penalty kick),
the human referee can give both teams a certain amount of time (like 5min) to change their system.
This time can be applied multiple times, if needed, to eventually determine a winner.

Usage
Shoot-Out is used to determine the winner of an elimination match if both teams scored the same amount of goals in previous game stages.

11. Emergency stop

Definition
A team can ask to stop the game immediately after a grace period of 10 seconds or at the next stoppage, whichever happens first regardless of the current situation.
It will receive a yellow card for this and must take a timeout immediately.
If the team is out of timeouts, it is still allowed to remove robots from the field, but can not use any remaining timeout time.

This rule is supposed to be used in extreme situations only, e.g. a software crash or when robots are damaging themselves significantly.

When the game is stopped due to this rule, there are three possibilities that may have happened:

The grace period has passed and the game is stopped.

The human referee stopped the game earlier.

The game is stopped earlier due to the ball leaving the field or because of a foul.

For these possibilities there are two methods to proceed the game:

For 1 and 2, the game is continued with a free kick for the opposing team.

For 3, the game is continued like after a regular timeout.

Usage
An emergency stop intent can be made using communication flags.

The referee may stop the game earlier if there is no promising play in action.

12. Challenge Flags

A challenge flag allows teams to challenge a decision of the referee:

If referees decision was correct, team loses a timeout.

If referees decision was incorrect, the correct decision is applied and the team doesn’t lose a timeout.

The flag is consumed in both cases.

Only one ruling may be challenged at a time.

The team must have at least one timeout left before using a challenge flag.

Each team will receive three flags at the start of the game.

This rule is inspired by challenge flags in American football.

13. Rule Changes During Competition

Rule changes between years can have unforeseen consequences.
If a rule is found to cause significant negative impact to the competition, the rules may be adapted under the following conditions:

Only between phases of the competition, like round-robin and knockout

Only for major problems, as a last resort

The change must be approved by all team leaders (by an unanimity vote)

Division A plays on a larger field with larger goals than division B. As a result, a penalty kick is taken from a greater distance as well.

Division A plays with more robots than division B.

The automatic ball placement procedure is mandatory for division A and optional for division B.

The aimless kick rule only applies to division B.

Division A has shorter timeouts in some situations.

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2024 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2024
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2024 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at http://conferences.cs.umass.edu/robocup-ssl-2019
Every team can register and upload their qualification materials to the site.
- Registration: Main page, select " I'm a new user and want to create an account"
- Submission: After logging in, click on "Start new paper" (https://conferences.cs.umass.edu/robocup-ssl-2019/paper/new)
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):
A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. The game should be based on contemporary rules (2011 and afterwards).A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:
Subject: 2019 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.The URL of your video, which must be available via FTP or HTTP.
Please pay attention to the following:
Please submit a single video file.The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Field Configuration

The RoboCup 2018 will feature 3 fields.
Field A: 9x12m, used for official games of division AField B: 6x9m, used for official games of division BField C: 6x9m, used for testing (both divisions)
The time before the scheduled start of official games is reserved for the two opposing teams of the next match. If there is no time left between the end of a match and the scheduled start of the next match, testing time on the playing field cannot be granted.
On field C, testing time slots will be distributed by the OC. There will be three options:
One team can use the field as a half of a division A field (there will be a large goal as well)One team can use it as a full-size division B fieldTwo teams can use it simultaneously as a half of a division B field
After all games of the day have finished, all teams are free to test on either field. If there is too much demand, the OC will also coordinate it.

Tournament Format

Division A
Teams in division A will play a round robin group stage followed by a double elimination playoff stage.There are two groups, with 5 and 4 teamsThe team that places first or second the group starts in the upper bracketThe other teams start in the lower bracketNo team drops out after the group stage
Group Stage
Every group consists of three teams from pool 1 and one or two teams from pool 2The pools were decided using the results of previous official tournamentsThe rule that there is no more than 1 team from the same country in the same group will not be usedThe groups will be assigned using the SSL grouping tool and random.org

Dear SSL-community,as
 most of you should already know by now, we use to publish all our work 
each year during or after each RoboCup since we first participated in 
2011.And we 
continue with this attitude, because we belief in the importance of 
sharing knowledge to advance our league and the RoboCup.Below,
 you will find a list of our publications and a list of the most 
significant changes. The documentation or description is included within
 the individual packages.
Mechanics–
 Modified the curved front shape of the straight kicking plunger. This 
significantly reduced the spread of kicked balls when they are not 
perfectly at the center in front of the robot.- Enlarged the 
infrared barrier PCBs on the sides of the dribbling device to prevent 
the silicon rubbers of the linear damping mechanism to fall out 
seldomly.Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Mechanics-2018.zipElectronics– Usage of a new wireless module: Semtech SX1280-
 Schematics and PCB layout of a tiny 34x18mm module with a single SX1280
 module. Pin-compatible with most nRF24L01+ breakout boards on the 
market (SX1280.pdf).- Schematics and PCB layout of a 
completely new base station using one SX1280 module and the SKY66112 
front-end module for enhanced output power and antenna switching. 
Features network connectivity and a 5″ touchscreen with 800×480 pixels.Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Electronics-2018.zipFirmware– Support for the SX1280 and SKY66112 modules (in base station and mainboard code).- Enhanced wireless transfer protocol to make best use of the new modules.- Adaption of the base station code to the new hardware (incl. completely new user interface).- Base station touchscreen supports manual control of a single robot for demonstration purposes.- Base station can be configured via touchscreen.-
 New feature: Asynchronous Bang-Bang trajectories. They are 
intentionally not synchronized on the X and Y trajectory to reach a 
specific line/direction faster.- Major update of robot 
controller and sensor fusion. The robot now uses a state space 
controller with acceleration output and model-based friction 
compensation when a position source (e.g. SSL Vision) is available. If not position source
 is available, local velocity output is used with a velocity-error 
correction for encoder readings. All models are derived from empirical 
data.Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Firmware-2018.zipSoftware (TIGERs AutoRef)– Detect more rule violations- Updated to new rules- Significantly improved ball speed detection and chip kick detection (see Vision Filter)Code: https://gitlab.tigers-mannheim.de/open-source/AutoRefereeSoftware (AI)– Enhanced the integrated AutoRef for full automatic simulation of two teams playing against each other- Offensive Action Trees for self learning offensive behaviors (see ETDP)- Multiple new supportive behaviors for supporting the attacker- Improved the selection of the best suited attacker that should handle the ball- Improved the skills that handle the ball, like kicking, receiving, redirecting, approaching and catching- Integrated new asynchronous bang bang trajectories into multiple skills- More robust path planning with ahead-of-time emergency brakeRelease: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gzSoftware (Vision Filter)–
 New chip kick model: We are now using fixed restitution coefficients 
for all hops in Z direction, for the first hop in XY direction, and for 
all further hops in XY direction (3 parameters in total).- Online straight kick and chip kick estimation has been updated to use a direct simplex-based optimization method.- Chip kick estimation can now optimize a complete trajectory, not only two hops.-
 An additional optimizer can estimate all model parameters for a 
straight and chip kick with an evolutionary algorithm (CMAES). Model 
parameters can now be fully calculated within Sumatra, no further 
external software required.- The Vision Filter is completey integrated into our official AutoRef software.- Kick information from  our own robots is now used as a-priori knowledge for estimation.-
 The viewport architect, which aligns the viewports of the different 
cameras and tries to minimize overlap, now supports different modes of 
how the viewports are calculated. Based on field size, camera positions,
 camera projections, or dynamically on detected robot positions.-
 Correction of inbound SSL Vision timestamps. The average rate of each 
camera is estimated and the timestamps are corrected for each camera, 
mitigating network and processing delays. This increases filter accuracy
 for ball and robots.Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gzSoftware (status-board)–
 A new application for visualizing referee information during a game 
including new game events that are announced by the autoRefs.- Additionally, a live view of the field.Code: https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-status-board-clientApplication is available here (and will so during the RoboCup): https://tigers-mannheim.de/status-board/Looking forward to seeing you all in Montreal 🙂CheersTIGERs Mannheim

CONTENT:
In 2008, we will have a challenge setup similar to 2007. There will be two challenges to compare technical abilities needed for successfully playing robot soccer. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate almost without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge will probably benefit from their work.
Challenge 1 – Shooting and Passing
Put up to three robots on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after only one robot has touched the ball2 Points: Scoring a goal after two robots have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass)3 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes)
The rules for this challenge:
To start, all robots must be placed within 1m from the own goal line.Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles.A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the own side of the field.A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half.Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
Challenge 2 – Navigation
Two sets of obstacles (see attached sketch) are placed at each side of the field. One robot starts at the center of the field and must drive from one penalty mark of the field to the other as many times as possible within 120s. Every lap (from one set of obstacles to the other and back) counts as one point. Each time it has to drive through the gap between two obstacles. If it touches an obstacle, it gets a penalty of -1 points.
Additionally, teams are allowed to use up to three robots in parallel and sum up their laps. If two robots touch each other, the penalty also applies (per touching event, not per robot, of course).
If a robot has driven at least one lap (independently of the number of collisions), the team’s minimum number of points will be 1.
The red line indicates an example trajectory of a robot performing this challenge.
Challenges – Overall Ranking
The results from both challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let BALL_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the ball challenge and BALL_TEAM the number of points a single team received. Assume the same for the navigation challenge (NAV_*).
Then TOTAL_TEAM = BALL_TEAM / BALL_SUM + NAV_TEAM / NAV_SUM

Chip Kick Interception

The goal of this challenge is to detect and intercept chip kicks based on SSL Vision data.

Procedure
A chip kick is performed from 3 different locations by an opponent robot:

 From a corner to the center of the field From a corner along the long side of the field From the goal to the center
At each location, 4 kicks of different distances are performed.
These distances are 2m, 2.5m, 3m and 3.5m in random order.

A participating team places one robot on the field. The task is to touch the ball
before or shortly after it hits the ground for the first time. This shall imitate the defense problem when the opponent
plays chip kicks.

A participating team has to publish its software which is responsible for detecting chip kicks
and reconstructing the flight trajectory.

Score
Each successfull interception (i.e. the participating robot touches the ball before it hits the ground a second time) gives 3 points. If the ball is kicked instead of simply touched, 1 extra point will be awarded. If the ball is kicked into a goal, 1 further extra point will be awarded. This gives a total number of 60 possible points. 

Multi-Team Communication

The purpose of this challenge is an implementation demonstration of the SSL multi-team communication protocol.
Therefore, two participating teams perform various collaborative tasks using this protocol.
The mixed team has 15 seconds to accomplish each task.
This challenge assumes a simple master-slave relationship between the two collaborating teams.
This is, the master team sends a team plan to the slave team, which acts according to this plan.
In order to evaluate the behavior in accordance to the team plan, the master team
sends the team plan to an evaluator computer (run by the TC). This computer forwards
the team plan to the slave team.

Initial situation for each task
The referee command before the actual tasks is Stop. The robots of both teams
have to be located within 1 meter distance to the middle line between the two goals.
The goalie has to be located in the defense are and has to remain there during all tasks.

Task 1
This task
 is signaled by a GameForce referee command.
All defenders have to move to the own goal, all attackers to the 
opponent goal. Every robot of the joint team except for the goalie
must be assigned either a Defense or Offense RobotRole.
There have to be at least 2 defenders and 2 attackers.
The task is fulfilled when all robots are located within 2 meter 
distance to the particular goal’s center, but not inside the defense or 
attack area.

Task 2
This task is signaled by an Indirect Freekick command for the opponent team (which
is not present at the field).

9 defenders have to be located with less than 10 centimeters distance to the defense area, but
not occupying or touching the defense area. The master team should prescribe the target positions
in order to avoid positioning conflicts.

Task 3
This task is signaled by an Indirect Freekick command for the mixed team.

The master team chooses one of the partner team’s robots and 
plays a pass to this robot. The task is fulfilled
if no other than this robot and the kicker of the freekick touched the 
ball
before it entered the opponent’s goal. The chosen robot of the Slave 
team is indicated
by sending a shot_target to this (and only this) robot in its RobotPlan.
If the ball leaves the field without scoring a goal, or if another robot
 than the two mentioned touched the ball, no points are scored.

Score
Each 
successfully accomplished task gives an 5 points, remaining seconds are 
added up as points. Both teams receive the same amount of points.
This gives a total number of 60 possible points.

The best 4 scoring teams will be qualified to compete in the Mixed Team Challenge.

Guiding Principles

This section contains an overview of the general guiding principles of the RoboCup Small Size League (SSL). Each principle has its own section describing the goal and its motivation. Any changes in this section should be informed to and discussed with the whole league.

Human Interpretability

In order for the public to understand the progress of AI and robotics, it is important to demonstrate it on interpretable tasks and systems. Soccer is a game understood and played around the world making it an ideal task. As we develop the rules, AI, robots and other systems in RoboCup SSL, we keep the game understandable by the general public.

We want for any spectator to be able to understand the game at any point, without having previous context. In other words, anyone who arrives at any match at any point, should easily be able to determine:

Which team is which

Which team is winning

What is the phase of the game (first half, half time, second half, etc.)

Interesting Gameplay

The original idea of playing soccer with robots was to have a platform for research that is well known to the public, so that progress in research can more easily be seen by everyone and people will get motivated to join us within the field. Getting and keeping attention by the public is only possible, if the games are exciting and easily understandable. Additionally,

the organisation and some teams depend on funding from sponsors. If the games do not entertain, or show the desired progress, this funding can get lost.

Robustness to Real World Uncertainty

The world is messy and full of uncertainty. Between partial observability, noise in sensors and actuation, and modeling errors it is important that our robots and AI are robust to this messiness.

Striving for full autonomy

One of the big objectives of the RoboCup Organization is to be able to have autonomous games and therefore, we want to reduce the human interference as much as possible, so as to truly be autonomous. Therefore, we aim for a fully autonomous team of robots and fully autonomous matches between two independent teams without any human interaction, including no human referee.

Encourage scientific discourse

One of the main objectives of the RoboCup Organization is to “promote robotics and AI research, by offering a publicly appealing, but formidable challenge”. It is important to keep in mind not just the challenge part, but the promotion of research done by teams in the SSL. In order to do so, teams in the SSL must be open to changes that encourage new AI and robotics research, and teams must also work to engage with each other, RoboCup at large, and the wider research community. New challenges may require significant work from teams in the league, but have the potential to improve robotics and AI both inside and outside the context of RoboCup. Additionally, teams should strive to publish and share their techniques and research both within the SSL but also to RoboCup as a whole and the wider AI and robotics communities.

Long Term Goals

This section contains an overview of the long-term goals of the RoboCup Small Size League (SSL) for the next 5 to 10 years. Each goal has its own section describing the goal, its motivation in at least one guiding principle, how we will evaluate progress towards this goal and references to related work done in other RoboCup leagues and the wider robotics and AI communities. Any changes in this section should be informed to the whole league.

Human-in-the-loop Autonomy

Motivation

Our current level of technology allows us to make narrow, task-specific AI systems that perform well. However, there are still areas in SSL that are done manually right now. As a step towards general AI systems that can handle these jobs, it is important to have human supervision to make sure the systems are functioning in a way that is safe, beneficial, and aligns with user values.

Schedule

Created: year 2020

Expected to be implemented by 2027

Conforming To

Striving for full autonomy, Human Interpretability

Progress Measurements

Improvements can be measured in terms of time saving, efficiency or error rate.

For example,

Existing automated procedures can be supervised by humans

Existing manual procedures can be supported by (partial) automation

Achievements so far

The SSL-Status-Board on a big screen supports the human referee and the spectators in understanding and judging the decisions of the Auto-Referee

References to Outside Work

Next Steps

Introduce a physical remote control for the teams

For automated robot substitution

For changing the keeper

Improving interaction between the human referee and the autoref (both have their strength and weaknesses; combining the strengths of both should be targeted)

Push towards less manual exchange procedures

Push automated robot substitution

Introduce automated robot substitution after cards

Add automated assistance for the vision expert

With a tool that shows quality issues and their locations

Reducing Stoppages

Motivation

We want to reduce stoppages due to hardware issues, software issues, rule violations and general game flow to a minimum. This helps in focussing on interesting parts of the game and keeping spectators attracted. More stoppages means less time for actual game time and makes it more difficult to schedule games during a tournament.

Schedule

Created: year 2020

Expected to be implemented by 2027

Conforming To

Interesting Gameplay

Progress Measurements

The match statistics show the relevant time usage of the different game phases.

In 2019 over all division A games, only 15% of the match time has been in RUNNING state.

Achievements so far

Next Steps

Increase the percentage of game-on time over the competition by adapting the rules

Allow robot substitution while the game is running

Do not stop for cards (give the team 10s to automatically remove the robot)

Turn multiple fouls into red cards, instead of penalty kicks

Avoid ball placement procedure, if not necessary

Only stop for a limited set of fouls, increment a counter for the others

Automatic Adaptation of Strategy

Motivation

The ultimate goal of AI research is to understand and create a system of general intelligence. While this is far off in the future, we currently have the ability to make narrow-task specific AI systems. Designing these systems, combining them, and adapting them to changes in the world and new areas currently requires a large amount of human effort. We want to reduce this effort and move towards more adaptable systems, for example have better online, dynamic adaptation of strategies and learning/planning of new strategies on the fly.

Schedule

Created: year 2020

Expected to be implemented by 2027

Conforming To

Robustness to Real World Uncertainty, Interesting Gameplay

Progress Measurements

Can we create a team with specific weaknesses (e.g. part of the defense area is undefended consistently) and a team, having never seen this weakness, exploit it consistently?

If a team has robots with performance capabilities outside expected (e.g. much faster movement, faster direction changes, etc.) can a team adapt their models of the opponents and their strategies to account for this?

If a team develops novel hardware (e.g. Op-Amps multi-directional kicker) can teams detect on-the-fly this new capability and automatically adjust strategy and play to defend against this capability?

Achievements so far

References to Outside Work

-

Next Steps

Motivate teams to work on innovations towards this goal

Relaxing SSL Vision constraints

Motivation

There is currently a global shared vision system that teams require tight tolerances on. We want to be more robust against failures in this system and less dependent on the tolerances. This may involve better filtering and processing of the data, additional local perception or shared software, but we mainly want to give teams the room for new innovations in this domain.

Schedule

Created: year 2020

Expected to be implemented by 2027

Conforming To

Robustness to Real World Uncertainty

Progress Measurements

The precision and reliability of the global vision system can be measured by analyzing ssl-vision messages from the network or a standard log file.

Statistics like the frame rate, the number of missing detections and the overall latency can be captured.

These statistics help in comparing the quality of ssl-vision detections in different events/matches and in identifying realistic relaxations on the tolerances.

Achievements so far

In 2019, the Vision Blackout Challenge has been held for the first time. It required teams to detect and intercept a ball without the global vision system.

References to Outside Work

-

Next Steps

Build an automated tool to check these tolerances

A first prototype can be found here

Define SSL-Vision tolerances that should be accepted by the teams

Relax these tolerances over time

More dexterous ball manipulation

Motivation

One basic research topic in Robotics is to manipulate objects dexterously like humans. As we can see in a human soccer game, keeping the ball does not mean to grasp/capture the ball. However, the current style of dribbling is close to grasp/capture the ball, which enables to keep the ball with relative ease. We want to keep the ball in a new style without depending on the current dribbler. This type of skill which consists of manipulating an object without completely capturing it, is known as nonprehensile manipulation, which can be a rich topic of research in the SSL. Meanwhile, we would need to bring everyone to a similar level of ball control in the current setup before making new changes to the ball manipulation rules. Also, some considerations regarding the material of the ball could occur, in order to adjust the difficulty, i.e., changing to a ball that has a greater deceleration than the current golf ball.

Schedule

Created: year 2020

Expected to be implemented by 2027

Conforming To

Robustness to Real World Uncertainty

Progress Measurements

In order to achieve this goal, new types of dribbling might appear, as well as an increase in the number of passes and a decrease in the occurences of the ball leaving the field.

Dear SSL community,
This year RoboJackets has started outsourcing our mechanical designs. Additionally, we are continuing our tradition of open sourcing our software, firmware, and PCB designs through GitHub. This year we have added a new project: A fully open source microcontroller board based on the Cortex M7 with an emphasis on being small enough to easily fit within small size league robots.

Dear SSL community,
As you may already know, we have open-sourced our electronics in January. Besides that, we would also like to share our mechanical design and vision process software. We hope these can help the SSL community. Detailed design specification and software guide can be found in the corresponding github repository listed below. 
Mechanics (Include 3D Design Files)
https://github.com/ZJUNlict/Mechanics
The mechanical design emphasizes on crash protection, maintainability and simplicity. The dribbler design is thoroughly explained. 
Electronics (Include Schematics, PCBs and Related Firmware)
https://github.com/ZJUNlict/Electronics
The design files are up-to-date. We also present the transition of design from 2012 to 2019 which may provide other teams a practical way to progress.
Software (mAn – Vision Process and GUI)
https://github.com/ZJUNlict/mAn
mAn is the main GUI of ZJUNlict. It also processes the vision and referee information (protobuf messages). 
Looking forward to see you all in Sydney!
Best wishes,
ZJUNlict

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested in participating must complete the followingactions by the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, whichis specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2025 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact’s name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be conducted via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of thequalification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submitqualification video material demonstrating their true currentcapabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) whatis expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting the minimumrequired criteria will only be considered for inclusion after all teams thatsubmitted compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separatetournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advancedteams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B.Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will havethe final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such ateam will attend as one team and must submit all qualificationmaterials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiplecomputers.

 
Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a TeamDescription Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP.Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams thatpresent substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCuptournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced withrespect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described indetail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long. This does not include references.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team mustbring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. Theposter must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will behung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2025
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existingaccount, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To createan account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. Tosubmit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Qualification Process

After the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, the OC will reach out by email to all teams that submitted the three required materials for qualification (video, participation intent, (E)TDP). This starts the single-blind peer-review phase: Each team is assigned three (E)TDPs and is tasked to review them, answer basic questions about the submissions and share concerns and ideas for improvement with the team and/or the TC/OC.
To keep the review single-blind, please avoid self-identifying yourself or your team in the comments or shared media. The single-blind review is important to us because it allows reviewers to share their concerns or criticize the submission without fear for retaliation.Failure to meaningfully review the submissions may result in disqualification of your team!
After the TDP Peer Review Deadline but on or before the Preliminary Team Qualification Results Announcement, TC/OC will contact each team (again, by email) to announce to them one of the following four Preliminary Qualification Status:

Qualified: If the video and the (E)TDP are of sufficient quality, a team is directly qualified for the RoboCup. They are still encouraged to improve their (E)TDP by incorporating relevant feedback, but this isn’t required to participate. Teams can (in extreme cases) lose their qualified status – by prolonged failure to reply to OCs emails that are crucial for running the competition. Qualified teams can withdraw for any reason from the competition by announcing their withdrawal to the OC. Teams are encouraged to announce their withdrawal as soon as they know to allow for teams to move up from the waiting list (and to allow for a smooth organization).
On the waiting list: We have to limit the number of participants for the RoboCup. If the number of applicants is higher than our capacity, we give out slots based on initial qualification material quality (with a higher significance on (E)TDP quality), and a few slots are given out by chance. Teams who have otherwise qualified, but who haven’t managed to get a slot are on the waiting list. In their email announcing this to the team, TC/OC includes the current position on the waiting list (ranked by qualification material quality). If a qualified team withdraws, TC/OC will go through the waiting list in order and search for a replacement team. Keep an eye on your emails! If you are on the waiting list and want to withdraw, please also announce that to the OC to speed up the process.
Conditionally Qualified: If the video and/or the (E)TDP have major flaws, teams are usually conditionally qualified. In their email announcing this decision, TC/OC gives a list of conditions the team has to meet by the Final TDP Submission Deadline to be allowed to compete in the RoboCup. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.
Not qualified: In extremely rare cases (with a unanimous vote in TC/OC) a bad (E)TDP submission can result in the team being not qualified, without a second chance to improve their submission. This is only for extreme cases, and reflects that conditional qualification is a huge drain on scarce resources: While your initial (E)TDP was reviewed by three of your peers, checking your updated (E)TDP after a conditional qualification has to be done by TC/OC members. Initially submitting an (E)TDP that clearly isn’t even close to be acceptable for qualification and planning on writing a decent one only for the final (E)TDP Submission Deadline is disrespectful towards your peers who had to waste time on a review you are not interested in, and is requiring the TC/OC to do a full review of your submission themselves.

TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020– This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardwareimprovements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also thereasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for otherteams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier forreviewers to read it. It also has no (self-)plagiarism.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper– This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planningsystem. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significantchanges in that area, and mentioning them would only mean havingduplicate information. The paper is also notexcessively long.
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020– This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, themechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It isa bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers eachtopic well and it has no (self-)plagiarism.
 
Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time.As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could resultsignificantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. Thequalification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old.If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams toprove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If yourvideo is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match,teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (seelisting below). The qualification video can be either of the followingtypes, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game(i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). Thevideo should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. Forparticipating in Division A, teams also have to show their ballplacement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a teamto compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams inthe qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2025 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in amodern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

DOCUMENT 340
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/divisions/
CONTENT:
Since 2018 the Small Size League is divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions.
Division Assignments
When submitting the qualification material, each team chooses a preferred division and includes a short rationale.
The Organizing Committee makes division assignments based on available spots at competition, previous performance, qualification materials, and team preference.
Motivation for Implementation
There are multiple benefits of having two divisions.
The SSL has a rather high entry barrier. Our goal is to further advance the league while keeping the entry barrier at a reasonable level. With splitting the league, we can challenge seasoned teams while still being attractive for newcomers. The qualification criteria for the division B can even be lowered a bit without hurting the competition.Feedback from RoboCup 2017 has shown that it is very important for teams to face off against opponents of similar skill. Dividing the league into two divisions rids a lot of the one sided games in exchange for more interesting match-ups.

================================================================================

DOCUMENT 341
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/tournament-rules/
CONTENT:
All teams must adhere to these formalized guidelines to ensure a smooth and successful competition. While some protocols have been used in past competitions, this page consolidates and clarifies them to maintain organization throughout the event.
Radio Setup
Each team must only use the radio frequencies assigned during the competition.

The 2024 Radio Frequency form is sent by the OC or TC a few weeks before the RoboCup at Discord and Mailing list.
Based on the team’s responses, TC will assign a radio frequency to be used during the competition.

Poster Presentation
Each Division A team must bring a poster presentation with its development and innovations to the competition.
Division B teams are highly encouraged to bring posters and present.

Poster aims to maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs and TDPs.
The poster must be roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Practice
During the competition, at least one field will be assigned to practice. Each team will have a few half-field 30-minute slots per day.

The number of slots varies depending on the number of teams, field availability, and competition schedule.
If your team needs the whole field, you should book 2 field halves simultaneously. Note that you will consume two slots in 30 minutes.

Pre-Game
Each game has 4 teams involved: 2 teams playing, one assigned as Referee and Game Controller, and another as Assistant Referee and Vision Expert. Every team should arrive at the field 15 minutes before the schedule, as the kickoff should start at the scheduled time.

If the previous game is delayed, the 15 minutes should start when the previous game finishes. Therefore, referees and teams have at least 15 minutes to prepare for the game.
In the 15 minutes, GC, Referee, Assistant Referee, and Vision Expoert should verify the SSL-Vision, auto-referee, set up the Game Controller, and score sheet, get an official ball, and verify the two playing teams.

At the match schedule time, if one of the teams is not ready to play, they should use their timeout. If the timeout ends, the referee can ask TC/OC for their opinion before enforcing a forced forfeit.

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2015. These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committees encourage all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
11-vs-11 Mixed Team Challenge
The 11 on 11 Technical challenge is a full match between two teams of up to 11 robots, each composed of robots from two different SSL teams (here referred to as sub-teams). Each robot must be controlled by its originating sub-team’s software. Sub-team pairings will be randomly drawn. The winners will be determined based on the number of valid goals scored.
Communication
Communication between the two sub-teams of a team is allowed, according to the following specifications:
Messages are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf to port 10012.Sub-teams communicate only a rough plan for each of their robots using the TeamPlan message specified by the multi_team_communication.proto Google protobuf:
 package multi_team_comm;
 //Protocol to communicate rough plans to other teammates

Rules
Standard SSL rules apply to mixed team games with the following additions:
A mixed team is formed from robots of two sub-teams.The maximum robot number is increased to 11 per mixed team. Each sub-team may have only a maximum of 5 players on the field at any time. Each sub-team may additionally provide a goalkeeper for one period. The goal keeper for the second period must not be provided by the same sub-team that provided the goalkeeper for the first period.Goals are only valid if robots from both of the two sub-teams forming a mixed team have touched the ball since the last stoppage of play.
Shared Radio Protocol Challenge
Overview
The goal of the shared radio protocol is to demonstrate teams playing soccer using other teams’ robots. This will allow (for example) teams of heterogeneous hardware, or mixed teams with one team’s software and another’s hardware.
For this technical challenge, the team that provides the robot hardware will be called the Radio Server Team (RST), and the team that controls the robots via software will be called the Radio Client Team (RCT). The RST will run a server that accepts data on the UDP port number 10010, receives the radio commands in the specified protobuf format, and send the commands over their own radio to the robots. The RCT will run the control software that will send radio commands in the specified protobuf format to the UDP port 10010 of the RST. This setup is depicted in the following figure:
Radio Protocol
The radio commands are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf, with the following protobuf definitions. Each wrapper packet contains multiple radio commands, for each of the robots to be controlled.
message RadioProtocolWrapper {
  repeated RadioProtocolCommand command = 1;
}

message RadioProtocolCommand {
  // The unique ID of the robot, as identified by SSL-Vision.
  required int32 robot_id = 1;

  // Desired forward drive velocity in meters / second.
  required float velocity_x = 2;

  // Desired sideways left drive velocity in meters / second.
  required float velocity_y = 3;

  // Desired counterclockwise angular velocity in radians / second.
  required float velocity_r = 4;

  // Desired flat kick speed, in meters / second.
  // If this optional field is missing, then no flat kick command should be
  // sent.
  optional float flat_kick = 5;

  // Desired chip kick distance, in meters.
  // If this optional field is missing, then no flat kick command should be
  // sent. If this field is present along with the flat_kick field, the
  // flat_kick command takes precedence.
  optional float chip_kick = 6;

  // Desired dribbler spin, from -1 to +1, where -1 is the maximum reverse-spin
  // that can be imparted to the ball, and +1 is the maximum forward-spin
  // that can be imparted to the ball.
  optional float dribbler_spin = 7;
}

Source Code
Source code for the defined protobufs, and sample RST and RCT executables, is available on GitHub.
Scoring
Both teams, the RST and the RCT are awarded the specified number of points each for every skill from the following list that they perform:
Driving a single robot in a straight line along the length of the field twice, from touching one goal line to the other goal line at the other end of the field, and back, along the middle of the field (1 point)Intercepting a moving ball travelling at ≥ 1 m/s, and bringing it to a stop. (1 point)Scoring a goal against a stopped defence consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders (1 point)Scoring a goal against a stopped defence consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders by a one-touch (deflection) kick of a moving ball travelling at ≥ 1 m/s. (2 points)Scoring a goal on the stopped defence after a pass between two robots (2 points).Scoring a goal on a moving 3-robot defence after a pass between two robots (2 points).
The skills will be evaluated as follows:
For skills involving moving balls, the ball will be rolled in by a human from the goal line towards the center of the field.For the skills involving scoring goals, the trials are started from game off state with the ball at the center of the field.For direct goal scoring, a force start referee command will be sent. For indirect goal scoring with passes, an indirect free kick referee command will be sent.Points are scored only once per skill. No additional points are awarded for repeating a skill, either to the RST, or RCT, with the same, or any other RST-RCT pairing.The RST team will be monitoring the computer, commands sent, and the robots, and may, at their discretion, abort the communication and end the trial at any time.The RCT and RST must both take appropriate precautions to maintain safety of the robots, and are expected to partake in the challenge in fair spirit. The RCT will not be held liable for any possible damage to the RST’s robots.

RobôCIn
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce a series of repositories that we plan to submit at this year’s open-source. Hopefully they will help grow our category here at RoboCup.
RobôCIn’s Plans for Future Software Development
rSoccer: https://github.com/robocin/rSoccer

Is an open-source framework to study Reinforcement Learning for SSL;

project-unification: https://github.com/robocin/project-unification
This project aims to demonstrate the use of the soccer-common framework (https://github.com/robocin/soccer-common), developed by RobôCIn and used in the RoboCup SSL and IEEE VSS categories. Also, the repository serves as a starting point to the team’s new developers and teams that want to start strategies on SSL.
Usage examples:

MatheusPaixaoG: https://github.com/MatheusPaixaoG/project-unification
matheuslafayette: https://github.com/matheuslafayette/projeto-seletivo-robocin
agaf2: https://github.com/agaf2/project-unification
acrucha: https://github.com/acrucha/project-unification
caiomvfc: https://github.com/caiovmfc/Seletiva-RoboCin-VSS-cvmfc

robocin-cpp: https://github.com/robocin/robocin-cpp

It is a library heavily inspired by abseil owned by Google, and seeks to extract what worked well from soccer-common, implementing software engineering best practices and modern C++ with a README-by-folder based documentation. It provides the core library for our next team’s robotics applications.

Floating-point comparison;
Angular/geometric operations;
In the long term it will be like libsrc in 2D for our team.

protocols: https://github.com/robocin/protocols
The protobufs used by the competition are widely dispersed in the repositories that require them, making it necessary to copy and paste the files that are currently being used in the category. Thus, the protocols used are highly duplicated in the RoboCup SSL softwares, but also in the team’s strategy softwares.
In this context, we propose a single repository containing the protocols used by as well as installation guidelines for various programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, etc.
robocin-ines: https://github.com/joseviccruz/robocin-ines, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-server, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-webui
robocin-ines provides a base framework for architecting robotic applications. This set of repositories comes as an optimization of our current software (ssl-unification), providing a microservices-based framework which:

Enables the use of different programming languages;
Uses the ZeroMQ framework to communicate services with latency below 1ms;
Defines a visualization on the Web, providing better development simplicity;

However, this final structure is not yet finalized and, as a way to validate the technologies, scope, and robustness of the system, the SSL VAR was developed as an MVP of this repository.
SSL VAR is a match recording system, which allows the viewing of the match in real time, as well as the analysis of past plays through replay at a given timestamp or according to a given event in the match, such as a foul, penalty, or goal. In this way, it allows the human referee to analyze a past play and check whether his decision and also the decisions of the automatic referees were correct or not.
The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a base structure for organizing new SSL teams using microservices, and to extend the life and maintenance of our current software.Best regards, RobôCIn.
RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
RoboFEI would like to submit our hardware and software works for the open-source award. We are happy to say that we have released all the mechanics, electronics, AI, and firmware for this year.
Regarding mechanics, the new robot’s generation is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/ssl-mechanics). The project aims for modularization that will help robot maintenance and assembly.
In electronics, both the main and kick boards have been changed aiming for modularization, besides the fact that the team replaced the FPGA with an STM microcontroller to modernize our robot, and you can see everything here in the link (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2). Besides that, our new firmware is released on our GitLab too (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2).
About the software, our ongoing research of multi-robot path-planning is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/leo_costa/RobotNavigation).
Best regards,
João VictorRoboFEI
ER-Force
Dear Small Size League.
ER-Force would like to submit their current hardware and software framework as well as its autoref for the open source award. [1, 2, 3]
A short summary:
The hardware project reflects the current state of the ER-Force robots, i.e. the new robot generation used by our team during this RoboCup. The hardware is designed in EAGLE (electronics) and Inventor (mechanics). The electronics section contains prebuilt manufacturer files (Gerber) as well as schematics as PDF, the mechanics part is depicted in assembly drawings.
The software framework reflects the open-source simulator as well as some low level algorithms such as our path planning. The software framework is written in C++ and Qt.
Finally, our open-source projects include our well-known autoref, which is used by the league for many years.
Best regards,
MikeER-Force
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-Community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. The usual one-stop shop to get it all was updated:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, firmware, our full AI, and someawesome new tools. Here is a brief description of what has changed.
Mechanics:The dribbler dampening and dribbling bar have changed again to improvetraction on the ball. These are mostly material changes. The axes of thesub-wheels changed to be more robust. The release includes the fullrobot mechanics. Inventor CAD files, but also a STEP file of the full robot.
Firmware:Dribbler current control has been improved near zero velocity. Interfaceto the robot’s raspberry pi has been improved with new messages andfeedback of detected balls. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Pass finding has been largely improved and nowcontains a dynamic learning component. Also watch out for some moreserious dribbling moves which will make you sweat.
RobotPi:The software for ball detection running on a Raspberry Pi 3A+ on each ofour robots. Most of the color blob detection and thresholding has beenrewritten and is parallelized via multi-threading. The RPi uses onlyaround 50% of its CPU now.
TIGERs CLAV (Cut Lengthy Audio/Video):This is an C++ ImGui based application able to cut video files based onan SSL gamelog. You can synchronize multiple videos and gamelogs withindividual markers and the tool can then cut out non-running stages.This tool is still quite new and may not support every video format, butnonetheless it is already a great help to preprocess videos frommatches. Oh and it can create a status overlay video for your videos,too (similar to the status board).
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL community,
Hereby, RoboTeam Twente would like to submit our projects for the Open Source Award.
RoboTeam Twente WikiRoboTeam Twente AI SoftwareRoboTeam Twente EmbeddedRoboTeam Twente AutoRefHigh Speed USB Library for STM32Chat-TDP
Our Wiki provides all the mechanical and electrical designs of our robots. Furthermore, it contains the theoretical background and additional explanations about our AI and control software.On our Github you can find our new path planning within our AI code, as well as our innovative dribbler ball-sensor code (see this year’s ETDP).
This year we created an AutoRef, allowing for a majority vote between all AutoRefs. This software is under active development, but our AutoRef will most likely be used during RoboCup 2023.
Next to that, we developed a high speed USB library compatible with our STM32 chip. This results in an enhanced stability when connecting USB devices to the STM32F676ZI. With minor modifications, this is also suitable for other STM chips.Lastly, our latest innovation is our very own Chat-GPT, containing all information on all the (E)TDPs within the SSL. Just ask your question, and the answer will be provided. This Chat-TDP is currently still under construction, but great progress has already been made and we feel like this could be beneficial for all teams within SSL.
Thank you!

Dear SSL community,
as in past years, we are happy to submit our entry for the Open SourceAward.
You will find a list of our publications below.
Framework + Simulator:
This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI. It is able to– receive and process real life vision data– simulate SSL games– control robots– create game recordings and play them back…and much more.
New features since last years RoboCup include:– A new dribbling filter– Basic Git integration (i.e. show the Commit the binary is built from)Git integration into our log format will be released soon afterRoboCup– Various bug fixes and small features
The repository also contains our simulator, bundled as a standaloneexecutable for usage in this years RoboCup.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework
Autoref
This is our automatic referee, that detects the various ruleinfringements teams can commit during a SSL game.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/autoref
In case you have questions about our software or are just curious, feelwelcome to write an email to info@robotics-erlangen.de
Best regardsPaul BergmannER-Force
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL-Community,
For the first year since competing RoboTeam Twente is ready to enter for the Open Source Award. As all of our team members change (almost) in full every year we strive to have detailed and easy to understand documentation for everyone. This means that apart from all our designs we have collected all our recent how-to’s, design decisions and detailed explanations into a wiki. This wiki we also use to introduce new people to our team, so we hope it can be especially helpful for newer teams and those who are looking into tips for building enough robots to transition to division A.
Our wiki can be found here: https://wiki.roboteamtwente.nl/
Although the wiki also describes all previously made design in terms of hardware and software, some highlights of the changes we made this year include:
– Transitioning to a modular design with hardware and electronics combined for faster repair and more extensive testing. (rationale)- A fully renewed Front Assembly, which contains our dribbler and a new dampening mechanism. (design | rationale)– Custom made space-saving solenoids for kicking and chipping which freed up quite some space in our robots. (design | rationale)– Newly designed path planning based on bang-bang trajectories. (rationale)
We hope this can help other teams in their process of improving the SSL robots. If you have any questions we are more than happy to answer them, and if you find it useful we would love to hear that from you. We look forward to seeing you all at the RoboCup!
Kind regards,
Anne van Harten | RoboTeam Twente
RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-penny concept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community that have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our repositories.
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages: C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
To improve the quality and usefulness of our open-source material we’ve started slowly changing our code base from portuguese to english. Although it demands a great effort to translate all the previous code, we believe that this should greatly improve the accessibility of our code base to the league.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages: C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and it in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end of the game, the software generates the information of all moves occurred on the match.
We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. By now there is a one-stop shop to get it all:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, and our full AI. Here is a briefdescription of what has changed.
Mechanics:The kicker and dribbler have been slightly updated to be more robust.The dribbler now allows prolonged periods of dribbling with highertorque. The release includes the full robot mechanics.
Firmware:The build system has been changed to CMake and the folder structure hasbeen reorganized. The dribbler control algorithm now allows bettercurrent and speed control. Test and model identification methods havebeen cleaned up and improved. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Watch out for some serious dribbling moveswhich will make you sweat 😉
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim

CONTENT:
A key distinguishing characteristic of the Small Size League is its tight integration of software and hardware, which is crucial to success. A purely simulated tournament may reflect the best in software, but it excludes hardware development and omits hardware-software integration. To address this gap, the SSL hardware challenges will be conducted alongside the virtual SSL soccer tournament for RoboCup 2021. The rules for the SSL Hardware Challenges require significantly fewer resources than a full-size SSL field setup, and takes into account the constraints identified by the SSL teams.
The rules of the hardware challenges are available in both HTML format optimized for viewing on electronic devices and as a PDF for printing:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.There are two divisions with separate tournaments: division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The teams may choose the division they want to play in, but the OC will have the final word.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every division B team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) and every division A team an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2020. 
To create an account, click on “Register”, next to the “New to CMT?” text. To submit a paper, click on the top left button “Create a new submission”.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage and be under 2 minutes long. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

TIGERs Mannheim – AudioRef
Dear SSL-Community,
As in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for the Open Source Award: The AudioRef!
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AudioRef
The AudioRef aims to improve the understanding of the current game state for referees, participants and spectators in an intuitive and immediate way. To achieve this the AudioRef awaits state changes, card changes, command changes and new game events in game controller packets and uses configurable sound packs to trigger appropriate acoustic signals like whistle sounds or voice shouts. The currently available English and German sound packs have been designed with a specific focus on conciseness, using an intuitive whistle pattern and trying not to describe the obvious. You’re welcome to contribute your own sound packs!
The AudioRef has already been used at two local competitions and German Open 2024. You can hear it in action in this video from the German Open tournament (with the German sound pack): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgTJf4Soo_w
and very likely at the upcoming RoboCup!
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curious, contact us on Discord or write us an email.

ER-Force – Software Framework
Hello everyone,
ER-Force’s submission for this year’s Open Source Award is our framework (https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework). This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI.
It is able to

receive and process real life vision data
simulate SSL games in a full physics simulation
control robots
create game recordings and play them back
run strategies written in Lua and TypeScript
…and much more.

Best regards,
Christoph Schmidtmeier, ER-Force
Ri-one – Software Framework – RACOON-MW
Dear RoboCup SSL Teams,
Hello,
We are excited to submit our project “RACOON-MW” for this year’s Open Source Award.
Project Overview:SSL-RACOON-MW aggregates information from the Vision server and GameController and provides various useful information such as ball speed and robot speed together.For more details, please check out our GitHub repository:GitHub link: https://github.com/Rione/ssl-RACOON-MW
This software will be a perfect fit for new team: not only will it calculate your robot’s speed, slope, and intercept from Vision packets, but it will also identify your team and the opposing team using a game controller and a mode for simulators.These are then compiled and sent together in a single packet for your custom-made AI. This allows the team to focus on developing strategies!
We have included detailed usage instructions within the repository for your review. We hope this project will be beneficial to other teams as well.
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

Twente – TDP Search Engine V2
Dear RoboCuppers,
Once again, innovation and inspiration flows through the RoboCup. After last year’s successful Open Source competition with the Search Engine V1 , we’re ready to innovate once again! We would like to present the Search Engine V2! The project has received a complete overhaul. You can find it here https://tdpsearch.com/ . The new version supports the following additional features:

Ask ChatGPT directly through the Search Engine!
Papers from all leagues (over 600 and going up)
Improved search results with the help of AI (it’s magic)
Filter and search TDPs on leagues
Filter and search TDPs on year
It should not randomly break down anymore! (Thanks Azure)

Want to know how to onboard computer vision? BehRobot from the Humanoid Teen League already has figured this out. Is reinforcement learning useful? BadgerBots from the Soccer Standard Platform League can tell you. For robot-to-robot communication, ask Dagozilla from the Midsize League. And of course you can search through the latest papers from the SSL!
As a fun little extra, there is an image at the end of this mail containing a word cloud of the most used search terms up to now. If you want to know why Tigers is very much in there, here is a hint: “When in doubt, git clone Tigers” ~ Jorn, RoboTeam Twente

Immortals – AI software – Tyr
We are excited to submit our AI software, Tyr, for consideration in the open-source award category.
Tyr has been written from scratch for this year’s RoboCup, using parts of our old code with main focus on improving debug-ability and ease of development.
You can access the source code and documentation on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Immortals-Robotics/Tyr

RobôCIn – Software Framework – ssl-core
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce ssl-core as our project submission for this year’s open-source competition. We hope it will contribute to the growth of our category at RoboCup.
ssl-core provides a framework for building distributed applications applied in the SSL environment that addresses the limitations of traditional monolithic software systems used in the category. The proposed approach is a microservice architecture that allows independent development and deployment in any technology, enhancing agility and reducing the risk of system-wide failures. 
To validate the system’s technologies, scope, and robustness, we developed the SSL VAR as an MVP of this repository aiming to use it in official competitions in the near future. SSL VAR provides real-time 3D visualization of the match (see figure below), as well as an analysis of past plays through replay at specific timestamps or events, such as fouls, penalties, or goals. 

To improve the separation of concerns within the system, the application’s GUI was detached from the core business logic handled by adopting a microfrontend architecture as a modern approach to building user interfaces. Thus, the microfrontend services can be separately deployed and accessed as a vision client, similar to the ssl-vision-client, but providing 3D visualization with the same functionalities as the complete proposed SSL VAR system.
Docker is the only dependency to run the SSL VAR.  To test in RoboCup, simply clone the repository and run:
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.robocup-2024-var.yaml up –build
For more information, visit our repository, we are always looking for enthusiastic contributors! Your contribution can make a big difference. Join our team and help us make the project even better!

luhbots soccer – Chipper with single coil for both chipping and kicking
Dear SSL Teams,
The luhbots soccer team is excited to submit our entry for the Open Source Award.
We present our innovative chipper, which utilizes a single coil for both chipping and kicking operations. This design offers several significant benefits:

Only one charge control circuit is required.
The simple design makes it easy for other teams to adopt.
It is an add-on to the original kicker, so no new design is needed. It can be adopted by teams currently limited to kicking.
Using a single, larger coil provides greater potential for design optimization.
Can be made entirely from 3D-printed parts.

You can find the repository with all design files here: https://github.com/luhsoccer/luhsoccer_chipper_2024Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
Best regards,Sebastian Knackstedtluhbots soccer

DOCUMENT 358
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2009-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
In 2009, we have two basic technical challenges, similar to 2008. These two basic challenges are intended to compare technical abilities needed for successfully playing robot soccer. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate almost without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge will probably benefit from their work. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed slightly from their respective 2008 versions.
Additionally to the two basic challenges, we have an enhanced Challenge for Mixed Team Play which will also involve the usage of the new SSL Shared Vision System.
Basic Challenge 1 – Shooting and Passing
Put up two to three robots on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after two robots have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass)2 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes)
The rules for this challenge:
To start, all robots must be placed within 1m from the own goal line.Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles.A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the own side of the field.A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half.Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
Basic Challenge 2 – Navigation
Two sets of obstacles (all within 180mm diameter and marked with a standard blue or yellow center marker) are placed at each side of the field, at the approximate initial coordinates as shown in the attached sketch. One robot starts at the center of the field and must drive from one penalty mark of the field to the other as many times as possible within 120s. It must do so by alternating the side of entry between the two sets of obstacles, thus effectively driving a figure-eight. Every successful lap (from one set of obstacles to the other and back, while maintaining the figure-eight requirement) counts as one point. If it touches an obstacle, it gets a penalty of -1 points. Note, that the positions of the obstacles can change slightly during the execution of this challenge (e.g. by a robot bumping into them, or by a human repositioning them), so your system should accomodate for that.
Additionally, teams are allowed to use up to three robots in parallel and sum up their laps. If two robots touch each other, the penalty also applies (per touching event, not per robot, of course).
If a robot has driven at least one lap (independently of the number of collisions), the team’s minimum number of points will be 1.
The red line indicates an example trajectory of a robot performing this challenge.
Mixed Team Challenge
One of the aims of the Small Size League is to foster the development of cooperating agents. The current state of the art is to control all members of one team by a central intelligence instance which has a complete knowledge about the current state of each robot. Even in teams which have a distributed artificial intelligence component, every robot has detailed information about the behaviours of its team members and thus can deduce own actions which lead to an overall cooperative behaviour of the whole team. The aim of this challenge is to define a scenario for “real” cooperation, i.e. to let robots cooperate which do not have any knowledge about the internal state of all other robots of their team. This is intended to become realized by mixing existing teams which then have to accomplish a modified version of the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”.
Mixing Teams
First of all, a mixed team needs to be defined:
For the 2009 challenge, we consider a mixed team as a team of four robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each of these two sub-teams has to provide two robots. Every robot is controlled by its own software stack. Of course, all members of a mixed team have the same team marker colour. For this year, there will not be any communication between the different sub-teams. A mixed team must use the new SSL Shared Vision system.
As procedure for creating the mixed teams, the following approach will be applied:
Until June 17th (two weeks before the start of the competition), each team that is interested in participating in the challenge has to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.Every team that intends to participate in the mixed team challenge has to successfully participate in the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”, i.e. to score at least three points. This is necessary to assure a minimum level of passing skills.After the round robin stage of the soccer competition (i.e. on Friday afternoon), the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” become generated semi-randomly. Since there are several field assignment constraints for the finals (see section about “Time and Fields”) not every pair of teams is reasonable from an organizational point of view.
The Challenge
The task to accomplish is almost identical to the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”. Except the different number of robots (exactly four instead of up to three), the only difference is the scoring scheme: A pass will only be considering as valid if it has involved robots originating from two different teams.
Time and Fields
The challenge will be conducted during the two final days. Among the finals and the Humanoid Small Size demonstrations, there will be – especially on Sunday – enough free time slots. These slots will become assigned dynamically on site. There will be four SSL fields at the competition site. One of these fields will be used for Humanoid Small Size demonstrations during the weekend. Two others (on Sunday only one) are needed for official games. The remaining field can be used exclusively for the challenge. The two game fields can also be used (e.g. by those teams still participating in the competition) but only in a way that minimally disturbs the preparations for the official games.
Optional Game Demo
If some teams volunteer to show a mixed full 5 vs. 5 SSL soccer match, we would strongly appreciate and support this. Nevertheless, this will not be considered for the overall challenge ranking.
Overall Challenge Ranking
The results from the three challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let BALL_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the ball challenge and BALL_TEAM the number of points a single team received. Assume the same for the other two challenge (NAV_* and MIXED_* respectively).
Then TOTAL_TEAM = BALL_TEAM / BALL_SUM + NAV_TEAM / NAV_SUM + MIXED_TEAM / MIXED_SUM

DOCUMENT 361
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/technical-overview-of-the-small-size-league/
CONTENT:
This page gives a technical overview of the league. It is meant to give people that are not yet familiar with how the SSL is structured a first high level overview and references to where to look for more information.

SSL Components
The following figure shows the different components and how they interact with each other:

SSL-Vision
This is the official, league-maintained software for robot and ball detection. It is responsible for transforming images from all cameras over the field to coordinates that are broadcast to the teams via multicast. During a competition, it is set up by the technical committee. Teams do not have to take care of it. However, the detections are not reliable and require further processing. Also, for division A there are two cameras. Detections can be on both cameras and need to be merged accordingly.
SSL-Vision on GitHub
SSL-Game-Controller
A match is coordinated by the SSL-Game-Controller. It is running on a computer next to each field and has a UI for the game controller operator. The game controller broadcasts referee messages via multicast, just like SSL-Vision. Additionally, there are synchronous network interfaces for autoRefs and teams to communicate bidirectionally.
SSL-Game-Controller on GitHub
AutoRefs
There are automatic referees that supervise a match and support the SSL-Game-Controller, mainly with detecting fouls. In order to increase robustness and fairness of the foul detections, multiple AutoRefs can (and will) run simultaneously and decisions can be based on a majority vote.
There are two implementations that are currently under active development by teams and that are used since RoboCup 2018: 

ER-Force
TIGERs Mannheim

For reference, the following implementations also exist, but are not currently in use:

ssl-autonomous-refbox (one of the first prototypes)
CM Dragons
RoboTeam Twente

Simulators
The Simulation Protocol defines a common way to communicate with an SSL simulator. It has been initially introduced for the virtual tournament at RoboCup 2021. The common protocol should encourage teams to publish their simulator or to use other open sourced simulators. By having a common protocol, switching between different implementations gets easier.
The protocol allows simulators to add some custom definitions, like additional realism configurations.
There are currently two open-sourced simulators available: 

grSim
ER-Force simulator

Vision Trackers
The data that is published by SSL-Vision is only raw positions per camera. They are noisy, can vanish sometimes and there is no velocity included.
Not only teams have to take care of that, but also the autoRefs. Since RoboCup 2023, the autoRefs officially publish their filtered/tracked data. Teams, especially new ones, are welcome to use this data instead or in addition to the SSL-Vision data. The SSL-Game-Controller also consumes these packages.
You can find the Vision Tracker Protocol on GitHub.
Team AI
Teams have to write their own software framework that is capable of receiving data from ssl-vision and ssl-game-controller and to communicate with their robots. The communication to the robots is not yet standardized. Most SSL teams use either low-level radio modules that work in the 2.4 GHz range or use 5 GHz Wifi.
Team Robots
Teams have to build their robots from scratch. They have to comply to the rules, mainly fit into a 180x150mm cylinder. A lot about how to design a robot can be found in the Open Source Contributions and the TDPs.
Additional League Infrastructure
League-maintained software is stored and managed in the RoboCup Small Size League Github organization. Although the repositories are maintained by the Technical Committee, contributions from all members of the community are highly encouraged.
There are a couple of interesting repositories:
SSL-Log-Tools
The ssl-go-tools contain several CLI tools to work with SSL Gamelogs, including:

ssl-auto-recorder: Automatically detect new matches and create individual logs per match
ssl-log-recorder: Record logs manually
ssl-log-player: Play a logfile back into the network
ssl-log-converter: Convert log files to a human-readable format – a JSON stream.

For  more tools, have a look at the repository.
SSL-Status-Board
The SSL-Status-Board can be run on a large screen to present the current state of the game to the audience and the human referee.
SSL-Vision-Client
A simple browser-based visualizer for the field.
SSL-Simulation-Setup
The Simulation-Setup has been created for the virtual tournament at RoboCup 2021 and can also be used for future virtual events or for testing a full setup with all league software.
SSL-Setup
The SSL Setup is used to set up all the required software for a real tournament. It contains scripts and Docker Compose configs to install everything on a fresh computer running Ubuntu.
SSL-Match-Stats
The SSL measures metrics and statistics over past RoboCups. The code for the Match Statistics is maintained on GitHub.

Protobuf Definitions
There are several different protobuf definitions, distributed over multiple repositories. This section gives an overview of the available definitions and links to the respective repositories for the latest version of the protocol.
In general, protocol updates will always be made in an compatible way on the transmission side, so that no software needs to be changed on updates. However, renaming and removing (with reserved flag) fields can be done, if there are good reasons for it.

SSL-Vision

SSL_DetectionFrame: Raw robot and ball detections per camera
SSL_GeometryData: Global field geometry, camera calibration per camera and ball model parameters
SSL_WrapperPacket: Message that wraps the DetectionFrame and GeometryData
TrackedFrame: Filtered robot and ball detections
TrackerWrapperPacket: Message that wraps the TrackedFrame with additional metadata (not produced by SSL-Vision, see SSL-Vision-Tracker-Protocol)

SSL-Game-Controller

Referee: The current game state with commands, game events, team state, etc.
Remote Control

AutoRef: Send detected game events to the GC
Team: Change the keeper id and request robot substitution
Remote Control: Control from external device, like RaspberryPi with Display

Continuous Integration: Single connection for integration of the GC into a teams software

SSL-Simulation-Protocol: A common protocol for different interchangeable simulator implementations
SSL-Vision-Client

Visualization: Send shapes (circles and lines) to the vision-client

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested in participating must complete the followingactions by the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, whichis specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2025 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact’s name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be conducted via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of thequalification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submitqualification video material demonstrating their true currentcapabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) whatis expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting the minimumrequired criteria will only be considered for inclusion after all teams thatsubmitted compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separatetournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advancedteams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B.Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will havethe final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such ateam will attend as one team and must submit all qualificationmaterials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiplecomputers.

 
Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a TeamDescription Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP.Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams thatpresent substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCuptournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced withrespect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described indetail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long. This does not include references.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team mustbring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. Theposter must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will behung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2025
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existingaccount, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To createan account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. Tosubmit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Qualification Process

After the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, the OC will reach out by email to all teams that submitted the three required materials for qualification (video, participation intent, (E)TDP). This starts the single-blind peer-review phase: Each team is assigned three (E)TDPs and is tasked to review them, answer basic questions about the submissions and share concerns and ideas for improvement with the team and/or the TC/OC.
To keep the review single-blind, please avoid self-identifying yourself or your team in the comments or shared media. The single-blind review is important to us because it allows reviewers to share their concerns or criticize the submission without fear for retaliation.Failure to meaningfully review the submissions may result in disqualification of your team!
After the TDP Peer Review Deadline but on or before the Preliminary Team Qualification Results Announcement, TC/OC will contact each team (again, by email) to announce to them one of the following four Preliminary Qualification Status:

Qualified: If the video and the (E)TDP are of sufficient quality, a team is directly qualified for the RoboCup. They are still encouraged to improve their (E)TDP by incorporating relevant feedback, but this isn’t required to participate. Teams can (in extreme cases) lose their qualified status – by prolonged failure to reply to OCs emails that are crucial for running the competition. Qualified teams can withdraw for any reason from the competition by announcing their withdrawal to the OC. Teams are encouraged to announce their withdrawal as soon as they know to allow for teams to move up from the waiting list (and to allow for a smooth organization).
On the waiting list: We have to limit the number of participants for the RoboCup. If the number of applicants is higher than our capacity, we give out slots based on initial qualification material quality (with a higher significance on (E)TDP quality), and a few slots are given out by chance. Teams who have otherwise qualified, but who haven’t managed to get a slot are on the waiting list. In their email announcing this to the team, TC/OC includes the current position on the waiting list (ranked by qualification material quality). If a qualified team withdraws, TC/OC will go through the waiting list in order and search for a replacement team. Keep an eye on your emails! If you are on the waiting list and want to withdraw, please also announce that to the OC to speed up the process.
Conditionally Qualified: If the video and/or the (E)TDP have major flaws, teams are usually conditionally qualified. In their email announcing this decision, TC/OC gives a list of conditions the team has to meet by the Final TDP Submission Deadline to be allowed to compete in the RoboCup. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.
Not qualified: In extremely rare cases (with a unanimous vote in TC/OC) a bad (E)TDP submission can result in the team being not qualified, without a second chance to improve their submission. This is only for extreme cases, and reflects that conditional qualification is a huge drain on scarce resources: While your initial (E)TDP was reviewed by three of your peers, checking your updated (E)TDP after a conditional qualification has to be done by TC/OC members. Initially submitting an (E)TDP that clearly isn’t even close to be acceptable for qualification and planning on writing a decent one only for the final (E)TDP Submission Deadline is disrespectful towards your peers who had to waste time on a review you are not interested in, and is requiring the TC/OC to do a full review of your submission themselves.

TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020– This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardwareimprovements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also thereasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for otherteams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier forreviewers to read it. It also has no (self-)plagiarism.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper– This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planningsystem. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significantchanges in that area, and mentioning them would only mean havingduplicate information. The paper is also notexcessively long.
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020– This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, themechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It isa bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers eachtopic well and it has no (self-)plagiarism.
 
Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time.As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could resultsignificantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. Thequalification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old.If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams toprove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If yourvideo is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match,teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (seelisting below). The qualification video can be either of the followingtypes, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game(i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). Thevideo should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. Forparticipating in Division A, teams also have to show their ballplacement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a teamto compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams inthe qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2025 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in amodern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by February 1st, 2022:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2022 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.
The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
The TDP should be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
We have to set up a conference management system to handle this year’s peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2022.
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2022 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Dear SSL community,
as in past years, we are happy to submit our entry for the Open SourceAward.
You will find a list of our publications below.
Framework + Simulator:
This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI. It is able to– receive and process real life vision data– simulate SSL games– control robots– create game recordings and play them back…and much more.
New features since last years RoboCup include:– A new dribbling filter– Basic Git integration (i.e. show the Commit the binary is built from)Git integration into our log format will be released soon afterRoboCup– Various bug fixes and small features
The repository also contains our simulator, bundled as a standaloneexecutable for usage in this years RoboCup.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework
Autoref
This is our automatic referee, that detects the various ruleinfringements teams can commit during a SSL game.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/autoref
In case you have questions about our software or are just curious, feelwelcome to write an email to info@robotics-erlangen.de
Best regardsPaul BergmannER-Force
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL-Community,
For the first year since competing RoboTeam Twente is ready to enter for the Open Source Award. As all of our team members change (almost) in full every year we strive to have detailed and easy to understand documentation for everyone. This means that apart from all our designs we have collected all our recent how-to’s, design decisions and detailed explanations into a wiki. This wiki we also use to introduce new people to our team, so we hope it can be especially helpful for newer teams and those who are looking into tips for building enough robots to transition to division A.
Our wiki can be found here: https://wiki.roboteamtwente.nl/
Although the wiki also describes all previously made design in terms of hardware and software, some highlights of the changes we made this year include:
– Transitioning to a modular design with hardware and electronics combined for faster repair and more extensive testing. (rationale)- A fully renewed Front Assembly, which contains our dribbler and a new dampening mechanism. (design | rationale)– Custom made space-saving solenoids for kicking and chipping which freed up quite some space in our robots. (design | rationale)– Newly designed path planning based on bang-bang trajectories. (rationale)
We hope this can help other teams in their process of improving the SSL robots. If you have any questions we are more than happy to answer them, and if you find it useful we would love to hear that from you. We look forward to seeing you all at the RoboCup!
Kind regards,
Anne van Harten | RoboTeam Twente
RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-penny concept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community that have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our repositories.
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages: C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
To improve the quality and usefulness of our open-source material we’ve started slowly changing our code base from portuguese to english. Although it demands a great effort to translate all the previous code, we believe that this should greatly improve the accessibility of our code base to the league.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages: C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and it in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end of the game, the software generates the information of all moves occurred on the match.
We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. By now there is a one-stop shop to get it all:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, and our full AI. Here is a briefdescription of what has changed.
Mechanics:The kicker and dribbler have been slightly updated to be more robust.The dribbler now allows prolonged periods of dribbling with highertorque. The release includes the full robot mechanics.
Firmware:The build system has been changed to CMake and the folder structure hasbeen reorganized. The dribbler control algorithm now allows bettercurrent and speed control. Test and model identification methods havebeen cleaned up and improved. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Watch out for some serious dribbling moveswhich will make you sweat 😉
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges and the Mixed team tournament will be held this year.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committes encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Until April 25th, teams interested in participating in any of the challenges or in the Mixed team tournament need to announce their interest to the Organizing Committee . This is necessary for the preparation of the schedules.
Passing and Shooting Challenge
To test the ability of coordinated passing and motion of the teams, in an environment with moving obstacles, the following challenge is proposed: Up to four robots, placed within areas on each side the field, must pass and receive the ball across four moving obstacles, repositioning themselves according to the sequence shown in the figure below and, at the end, score the goal.
Rules
Every received pass scores +1, and every intercepted or missed pass scores -1;There’s a bonus of +3 for scoring the goal;If the ball is intercepted, stops or goes out of bounds, it will be placed on the start position;The moving obstacles will travel at 1m/s speed, with slight variation allowed;The location of the obstacle robots will follow the figure, however their exact position may vary slightly;Robots cannot leave the areas of the field designated for them;Chip kicks are not permitted; – item added as Rule Clarification (June 7th)The size of each passing area is 1.25m x 6.1m, measured from the bounds of the field;Teams have 2 minutes to complete the challenge;Wins the team with higher score.
Pass/Intercept Challenge
Attention: This challenge’s format has changed on April 10th
This challenge tests both the ability to pass the ball in a reduced space, with adversaries, and the ability to intercept the ball when defending. The challenge occurs between two teams, on a half of the field. One of the teams, with up to four robots, tries to pass the ball as many times as possible, while the other team uses two robots to try to intercept the passes. Robots are free to move anywhere, as long as they respect the minimum distance between them, as shown on the picture below. The two teams swap passing and defending roles at the half-time interval.
Rules
Every received pass scores +2 and every intercepted or missed pass scores -1;If the ball is intercepted, goes out of bounds or stops, a referee halt signal will be sent and the ball placed again around the goal kick position;Passing robots must keep minimum distance of 1m between teammates for passing score to be accounted;Defending robots must keep minimum distance of 0.5m from the robot holding the ball;Referee can penalize with -1 each offense to the minimum distance rules;Matches will consist of 2 periods of 2 minutes, with approx. 30 seconds interval between;Team with higher score wins;The challenge will follow eliminatory match style. Brackets will be drawn on the day of the competition.
Mixed Team Tournament
This is a full match between mixed teams, each composed of six robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each robot will be controlled by its originating SSL team software. However, communication between the teams is allowed, as long as there is no direct control of the robots. The tournament format will let teams play matches as members of different mixed teams.
* The exact number of matches and schedule will be announced by the OC after the team confirmation deadline.
Rules
Both teams forming the mixed team must have the same number of robots on the field at the beginning of a match;All SSL rules will apply;Goals are only valid if robots from the two forming teams have touched the ball since the last game stoppage;The mixed teams will be formed by seeding.The winner is based off two round robins, a preliminary and a final one with advanced teams.

Technical Challenges of the Small Size League are intended to encourage teams to develop solutions to specific problems that will advance the quality of gameplay within the league. Teams are evaluated for their completion of the challenge during a designated time at RoboCup each year.
Rules
Below are the rules for the different RoboCup 2023 technical challenges. Source code associated with these challenges can be found on GitHub.
Chip Pass Challenge
This challenge will be similar to the Pass endurance Hardware Challenge from 2021. The goal is to perform as many passes as possible within a certain time. As an additional challenge, there will be more points if the ball is chipped.

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2023 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2023
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2023 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce a series of repositories that we plan to submit at this year’s open-source. Hopefully they will help grow our category here at RoboCup.
RobôCIn’s Plans for Future Software Development
rSoccer: https://github.com/robocin/rSoccer

Is an open-source framework to study Reinforcement Learning for SSL;

project-unification: https://github.com/robocin/project-unification
This project aims to demonstrate the use of the soccer-common framework (https://github.com/robocin/soccer-common), developed by RobôCIn and used in the RoboCup SSL and IEEE VSS categories. Also, the repository serves as a starting point to the team’s new developers and teams that want to start strategies on SSL.
Usage examples:

MatheusPaixaoG: https://github.com/MatheusPaixaoG/project-unification
matheuslafayette: https://github.com/matheuslafayette/projeto-seletivo-robocin
agaf2: https://github.com/agaf2/project-unification
acrucha: https://github.com/acrucha/project-unification
caiomvfc: https://github.com/caiovmfc/Seletiva-RoboCin-VSS-cvmfc

robocin-cpp: https://github.com/robocin/robocin-cpp

It is a library heavily inspired by abseil owned by Google, and seeks to extract what worked well from soccer-common, implementing software engineering best practices and modern C++ with a README-by-folder based documentation. It provides the core library for our next team’s robotics applications.

Floating-point comparison;
Angular/geometric operations;
In the long term it will be like libsrc in 2D for our team.

protocols: https://github.com/robocin/protocols
The protobufs used by the competition are widely dispersed in the repositories that require them, making it necessary to copy and paste the files that are currently being used in the category. Thus, the protocols used are highly duplicated in the RoboCup SSL softwares, but also in the team’s strategy softwares.
In this context, we propose a single repository containing the protocols used by as well as installation guidelines for various programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, etc.

robocin-ines provides a base framework for architecting robotic applications. This set of repositories comes as an optimization of our current software (ssl-unification), providing a microservices-based framework which:

Enables the use of different programming languages;
Uses the ZeroMQ framework to communicate services with latency below 1ms;
Defines a visualization on the Web, providing better development simplicity;

However, this final structure is not yet finalized and, as a way to validate the technologies, scope, and robustness of the system, the SSL VAR was developed as an MVP of this repository.
SSL VAR is a match recording system, which allows the viewing of the match in real time, as well as the analysis of past plays through replay at a given timestamp or according to a given event in the match, such as a foul, penalty, or goal. In this way, it allows the human referee to analyze a past play and check whether his decision and also the decisions of the automatic referees were correct or not.
The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a base structure for organizing new SSL teams using microservices, and to extend the life and maintenance of our current software.Best regards, RobôCIn.
RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
RoboFEI would like to submit our hardware and software works for the open-source award. We are happy to say that we have released all the mechanics, electronics, AI, and firmware for this year.
Regarding mechanics, the new robot’s generation is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/ssl-mechanics). The project aims for modularization that will help robot maintenance and assembly.
In electronics, both the main and kick boards have been changed aiming for modularization, besides the fact that the team replaced the FPGA with an STM microcontroller to modernize our robot, and you can see everything here in the link (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2). Besides that, our new firmware is released on our GitLab too (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2).
About the software, our ongoing research of multi-robot path-planning is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/leo_costa/RobotNavigation).
Best regards,
João VictorRoboFEI
ER-Force
Dear Small Size League.
ER-Force would like to submit their current hardware and software framework as well as its autoref for the open source award. [1, 2, 3]
A short summary:
The hardware project reflects the current state of the ER-Force robots, i.e. the new robot generation used by our team during this RoboCup. The hardware is designed in EAGLE (electronics) and Inventor (mechanics). The electronics section contains prebuilt manufacturer files (Gerber) as well as schematics as PDF, the mechanics part is depicted in assembly drawings.
The software framework reflects the open-source simulator as well as some low level algorithms such as our path planning. The software framework is written in C++ and Qt.
Finally, our open-source projects include our well-known autoref, which is used by the league for many years.
Best regards,
MikeER-Force
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-Community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. The usual one-stop shop to get it all was updated:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, firmware, our full AI, and someawesome new tools. Here is a brief description of what has changed.
Mechanics:The dribbler dampening and dribbling bar have changed again to improvetraction on the ball. These are mostly material changes. The axes of thesub-wheels changed to be more robust. The release includes the fullrobot mechanics. Inventor CAD files, but also a STEP file of the full robot.
Firmware:Dribbler current control has been improved near zero velocity. Interfaceto the robot’s raspberry pi has been improved with new messages andfeedback of detected balls. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Pass finding has been largely improved and nowcontains a dynamic learning component. Also watch out for some moreserious dribbling moves which will make you sweat.
RobotPi:The software for ball detection running on a Raspberry Pi 3A+ on each ofour robots. Most of the color blob detection and thresholding has beenrewritten and is parallelized via multi-threading. The RPi uses onlyaround 50% of its CPU now.
TIGERs CLAV (Cut Lengthy Audio/Video):This is an C++ ImGui based application able to cut video files based onan SSL gamelog. You can synchronize multiple videos and gamelogs withindividual markers and the tool can then cut out non-running stages.This tool is still quite new and may not support every video format, butnonetheless it is already a great help to preprocess videos frommatches. Oh and it can create a status overlay video for your videos,too (similar to the status board).
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL community,
Hereby, RoboTeam Twente would like to submit our projects for the Open Source Award.
RoboTeam Twente WikiRoboTeam Twente AI SoftwareRoboTeam Twente EmbeddedRoboTeam Twente AutoRefHigh Speed USB Library for STM32Chat-TDP
Our Wiki provides all the mechanical and electrical designs of our robots. Furthermore, it contains the theoretical background and additional explanations about our AI and control software.On our Github you can find our new path planning within our AI code, as well as our innovative dribbler ball-sensor code (see this year’s ETDP).
This year we created an AutoRef, allowing for a majority vote between all AutoRefs. This software is under active development, but our AutoRef will most likely be used during RoboCup 2023.
Next to that, we developed a high speed USB library compatible with our STM32 chip. This results in an enhanced stability when connecting USB devices to the STM32F676ZI. With minor modifications, this is also suitable for other STM chips.Lastly, our latest innovation is our very own Chat-GPT, containing all information on all the (E)TDPs within the SSL. Just ask your question, and the answer will be provided. This Chat-TDP is currently still under construction, but great progress has already been made and we feel like this could be beneficial for all teams within SSL.
Thank you!

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges and a demo will be held in Istanbul 2011.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate, and the Committes urge all the competing teams to compete in the challenges. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed from their previous versions.
Until June 20th (two weeks before the start of the competition), teams interested in participating in the challenge need to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.
Dynamic Navigation Challenge
**This challenge was used at the Iran open, with slight differences
The aim of this technical challenge is examine the ability of robots to safely navigate in a dynamic environment.
As it is shown in the pictures, there are 6 robots acting as obstacles, two stationary and four moving along a straight line. The approximate positions and trajectories are depicted in the figures. The actual position may vary.
1.1) The maximum number of participating robots are limited to 3.
1.2) The participating robots must navigate between the two stationary obstacles as shown in pictures.
1.3) Whenever a robot touches an obstacle or its teammate it will receive a penalty (-1).
1.4) Each successful navigation cycle for each robot is scored (+1).
1.5) Robots who can perform the cycle carrying the ball score (+3).
1.6) The challenge time is 2 minutes.
Mixed Team Match Challenge
This is a full match between mixed teams, each composed of five robots originating from two different SSL teams. One of the SSL teams must provide three robots and the other must provide two. Each robot will be controlled by its originating SSL team own software stack.
2.3) Teams who want to participate in this challenge must confirm its intention to the OC until June 20th. The OC also urges teams who want to participate to try to adjust their software before the match.
2.1) All SSL rules will apply
2.2) The mixed team can swap which of the originating teams provides three and which provides two robots
2.3) After the round robin stage of the soccer competition the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” become generated semi-randomly
Large Field Demo
A mixed match, similar to the Mixed Team Match Challenge, between 6 to 8 robots on each side, where each SSL Team will provide half of the robots for the mixed team. The field of play will consist of two official SSL-Fields joined as one, with SSL-Vision operating with four cameras. The log files of the demo games will be available after the competition to all SSL teams, and will serve to foster the development of systems capable of using the large field.
D.1) Teams who want to participate in this challenge must confirm its intention to the OC until June 20th.
D.2) All rules of the Mixed Team Challenge apply.
D.3) Participation on this demo is conditioned to participation on the Mixed Team Challenge

The following Open Source Submissions were made by the teams via email.
TIGERs Mannheim – AudioRef
Dear SSL-Community,
As in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for the Open Source Award: The AudioRef!
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AudioRef
The AudioRef aims to improve the understanding of the current game state for referees, participants and spectators in an intuitive and immediate way. To achieve this the AudioRef awaits state changes, card changes, command changes and new game events in game controller packets and uses configurable sound packs to trigger appropriate acoustic signals like whistle sounds or voice shouts. The currently available English and German sound packs have been designed with a specific focus on conciseness, using an intuitive whistle pattern and trying not to describe the obvious. You’re welcome to contribute your own sound packs!
The AudioRef has already been used at two local competitions and German Open 2024. You can hear it in action in this video from the German Open tournament (with the German sound pack): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgTJf4Soo_w
and very likely at the upcoming RoboCup!
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curious, contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
ER-Force – Software Framework
Hello everyone,
ER-Force’s submission for this year’s Open Source Award is our framework (https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework). This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI.
It is able to

receive and process real life vision data
simulate SSL games in a full physics simulation
control robots
create game recordings and play them back
run strategies written in Lua and TypeScript
…and much more.

Best regards,
Christoph Schmidtmeier, ER-Force
Ri-one – Software Framework – RACOON-MW
Dear RoboCup SSL Teams,
Hello,
We are excited to submit our project “RACOON-MW” for this year’s Open Source Award.
Project Overview:SSL-RACOON-MW aggregates information from the Vision server and GameController and provides various useful information such as ball speed and robot speed together.For more details, please check out our GitHub repository:GitHub link: https://github.com/Rione/ssl-RACOON-MW
This software will be a perfect fit for new team: not only will it calculate your robot’s speed, slope, and intercept from Vision packets, but it will also identify your team and the opposing team using a game controller and a mode for simulators.These are then compiled and sent together in a single packet for your custom-made AI. This allows the team to focus on developing strategies!
We have included detailed usage instructions within the repository for your review. We hope this project will be beneficial to other teams as well.
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
Best regards,

Twente – TDP Search Engine V2
Dear RoboCuppers,
Once again, innovation and inspiration flows through the RoboCup. After last year’s successful Open Source competition with the Search Engine V1 , we’re ready to innovate once again! We would like to present the Search Engine V2! The project has received a complete overhaul. You can find it here https://tdpsearch.com/ . The new version supports the following additional features:

Ask ChatGPT directly through the Search Engine!
Papers from all leagues (over 600 and going up)
Improved search results with the help of AI (it’s magic)
Filter and search TDPs on leagues
Filter and search TDPs on year
It should not randomly break down anymore! (Thanks Azure)

Want to know how to onboard computer vision? BehRobot from the Humanoid Teen League already has figured this out. Is reinforcement learning useful? BadgerBots from the Soccer Standard Platform League can tell you. For robot-to-robot communication, ask Dagozilla from the Midsize League. And of course you can search through the latest papers from the SSL!
As a fun little extra, there is an image at the end of this mail containing a word cloud of the most used search terms up to now. If you want to know why Tigers is very much in there, here is a hint: “When in doubt, git clone Tigers” ~ Jorn, RoboTeam Twente
Best regards,
Emiel Steerneman – RoboTeam Twente

Immortals – AI software – Tyr
We are excited to submit our AI software, Tyr, for consideration in the open-source award category.
Tyr has been written from scratch for this year’s RoboCup, using parts of our old code with main focus on improving debug-ability and ease of development.
You can access the source code and documentation on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Immortals-Robotics/Tyr
Best regards,
Ali Salehi,
On behalf of Immortals
RobôCIn – Software Framework – ssl-core
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce ssl-core as our project submission for this year’s open-source competition. We hope it will contribute to the growth of our category at RoboCup.
ssl-core provides a framework for building distributed applications applied in the SSL environment that addresses the limitations of traditional monolithic software systems used in the category. The proposed approach is a microservice architecture that allows independent development and deployment in any technology, enhancing agility and reducing the risk of system-wide failures. 
To validate the system’s technologies, scope, and robustness, we developed the SSL VAR as an MVP of this repository aiming to use it in official competitions in the near future. SSL VAR provides real-time 3D visualization of the match (see figure below), as well as an analysis of past plays through replay at specific timestamps or events, such as fouls, penalties, or goals. 

To improve the separation of concerns within the system, the application’s GUI was detached from the core business logic handled by adopting a microfrontend architecture as a modern approach to building user interfaces. Thus, the microfrontend services can be separately deployed and accessed as a vision client, similar to the ssl-vision-client, but providing 3D visualization with the same functionalities as the complete proposed SSL VAR system.
Docker is the only dependency to run the SSL VAR.  To test in RoboCup, simply clone the repository and run:
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.robocup-2024-var.yaml up –build
For more information, visit our repository, we are always looking for enthusiastic contributors! Your contribution can make a big difference. Join our team and help us make the project even better! 
Best regards,
José Cruz, Matheus Teotonio, Uanderson Ricardo and Andresa Silva,
Software Infra Team, RobôCIn-INES.
luhbots soccer – Chipper with single coil for both chipping and kicking
Dear SSL Teams,
The luhbots soccer team is excited to submit our entry for the Open Source Award.
We present our innovative chipper, which utilizes a single coil for both chipping and kicking operations. This design offers several significant benefits:

Only one charge control circuit is required.
The simple design makes it easy for other teams to adopt.
It is an add-on to the original kicker, so no new design is needed. It can be adopted by teams currently limited to kicking.
Using a single, larger coil provides greater potential for design optimization.
Can be made entirely from 3D-printed parts.

You can find the repository with all design files here: https://github.com/luhsoccer/luhsoccer_chipper_2024Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
Best regards,Sebastian Knackstedtluhbots soccer

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2024 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2024
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2024 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

RoboCup 2020/2021

Due to the circumstances in January 2021, RoboCup 2021 will be a fully virtual / decentralized event. All teams, even already qualified teams via the Qualification for RoboCup 2020 are advised to read the following point carefully.
Evey team intending on participating in RoboCup 2021 has to sent a participation intent. The details can be found under Qualification Criteria.The RoboCup 2021 will be consistent of two parts: A simulation based tournament, and a collection of four robot-based decentralized activities. To participate in the robot-based tournament, you need to have access to a field of at least 4x3m. The detailed rules for the robot-based tournament are still being drafted.There will not be different divisions in 2021. The robot-based tournament does not play normal matches, so divisions are not relevant there. In the virtual tournament, both teams have to agree on the used rules for each match. If no agreement is reached, the rules default to Division B.Due to the unusual circumstances regarding the qualification for Robocup 2021, the organizing committee might ask some more experienced teams to review some of the newly submitted TDPs, even if the reviewer are already qualified for the event.

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup game or one of the local regional competitions. The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill.A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Teams have been asking us if they could show a video of a simulation due to current COVID restrictions. We want to make clear that teams need to have real working robots to participate in the SSL for 2021. If teams cannot satisfy the requirements for the team video, they can use a simulation, but it has to be video of your robots participating in a (simulated) match (item 1 in the list). Additionally, teams should show to the best of their capabilities that they do have real working robots. 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:
Subject: 2021 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.The URL of your video, which must be available via FTP or HTTP.
Please pay attention to the following:
Please submit a single video file.The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Team Poster

Every team must bring a poster to the RoboCup competition that illustrates the content of the (E)TDP. The poster is meant to be hung up in the venue for everyone to see and read. Technical details how this is going to happen in 2021 will be added here as soon they are available.

CONTENT:
At RoboCup 2021 there will be a virtual tournament without any hardware involved. It will be played with the latest rule set, except that division A and division B teams will play in the same tournament. If one of the playing teams wishes to play with division B rules, the match will be played with division B rules.
The infrastructure for this tournament will be provided by the RoboCup organizers. Teams are expected to run their software on a Linux system, likely minimal Ubuntu 20.04 inside a custom Docker container.
The setup and configuration for the competition is available on Github, so every team can test it beforehand.
The tournament is hosted at https://virtual.ssl.robocup.org/
Procedure
The primary referee will control the game and should start preparing the next match at least 5 min before the scheduled start time. If the primary refereeing team does not show up 5 minutes before the scheduled start time, the secondary refereeing team will take over the role of the primary referee and the GC operator.
If a team does not show up within 10 minutes after the scheduled starting time or if one team forfeits, the other team will play on an empty goal in the group stage and will automatically win in the elimination stage.
Before each match
Initialize the game-controller
Start a new game.Enter the correct team names.Make sure that both autoRefs are connected.Make sure that all game events for both autoRefs are set to Accept.Make sure that all game events for GC are set to Majority.
Retrieve information from both teams
The Match Preparation from the rules apply, expect for the following differences:
Determine one main contact person per team (which takes the role of the robot handler and is the only one allowed to talk with the referee)Ask teams if both agree to play with DivA rules, else switch to DivB in GC.Determine team colors (like described in the rules)Determine which team will have the first kickoff (by flipping a (virtual) coin) and enter it into the GC.Ask teams for their initial keeper ids and set the id in the GC.
Start the game at the scheduled start time or soon after, when all teams are ready
Ask if teams are ready.Hit STOP in the GC.The match should automatically start with a kickoff as soon as all robots are at valid positions.
After the match
Make sure that the game is switched to the “end of game” stage at the top. This will stop the automatic recording.Submit the results to https://scheduling.virtual.ssl.robocup.org/results.

RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-pennyconcept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our publications on the last year:
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages:C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
The source code and the interface are all in Brazilian Portuguese idiom, so it might be difficult to use it for non-Portuguese speakers. Nevertheless, we are planning to add an English translation to the software; that way, the GUI could be used in both, English and Portuguese languages.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages:C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
Other additional functionalities like, download the Match League Log Files directly from the software and the use of predefined shortcuts provides an easy environment for the user watch Small Size League matches recorded or in real time.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and evaluates this move in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end, a file is generated with the results. We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.

CONTENT:
A key distinguishing characteristic of the Small Size League is its tight integration of software and hardware, which is crucial to success. A purely simulated tournament may reflect the best in software, but it excludes hardware development and omits hardware-software integration. To address this gap, the SSL hardware challenges will be conducted alongside the virtual SSL soccer tournament for RoboCup 2021. The rules for the SSL Hardware Challenges require significantly fewer resources than a full-size SSL field setup, and takes into account the constraints identified by the SSL teams.
The rules of the hardware challenges are available in both HTML format optimized for viewing on electronic devices and as a PDF for printing:

AutoRef Challenge

Goal of the Technical Challenge
This document is intended to describe the requirements of AutoRef software. The goal of this software is to help the human referee by automating decisions.

The Technical Challenge is conducted entirely before RoboCup 2016. 
Extended deadline for the AutoRef version that will be evaluated: March 14th 2016 (old deadline: Feb 28th 2016)

Setup and Requirements
The Autoref receives vision packets and sends its decisions to the traditional SSL Refbox which forwards
these referee commands to the actual game.
Both programs run on the same computer and communicate via network sockets.

The Refbox listens on Port 10007 for TCP connections communicating in the Refbox remote control format. 
The goal is to provide software that:

 detects as many infringements as possible (Alertness) minimize the number of false decisions (Accuracy) detects as many different infringements as possible (Completeness) subordinates to any decision a human makes on the Refbox is able to send commands for AutoPlacement has the ability to log a game in order to evaluate decisions is able to run on Ubuntu 14.04, with clear build instructions.
Evaluation
Subsequently,
 the submitted software will be tested. Every team is encouraged to 
conduct the tests and share their results. Ideally, a video of the tests
 is provided.

 A correctly detected rule infringement adds 1 point to the score of this Technical Challenge.  Every infringement will be tested multiple times according to the maximum number of points that is stated below. Wrong detection will subtract 2 points. Negative points in single infringements are possible.  The total points are the sum of all points. If the sum is negative,
 the result is treated as 0 points in this Technical Challenge.  The points will be normalized by the maximum number of points, which is 50. A team with 38 points will receive a 76% rating for this Technical challenge.

Submission
So far, the following AutoRef software has been submitted: CMDragons ER-Force Tigers Mannheim 

Autonomous Ball Placement

Goal of the Technical Challenge
The
 intention of this feature is to minimize the time needed to restart the
 game. This is achieved by placing the ball autonomously by robots (“AutoPlacement“).

The Technical Challenge is conducted on Thursday, after the games. 

Procedure
AutoPlacement commands are issued by the AutoRef software. They are forwarded by the Refbox as game states BallPlacementYellow or BallPlacementBlue and include the requested ball position. Before and after those commands the game is in Stop state.
AutoPlacement may be requested before any referee decision, e.g. before kickoffs, direct or indirect freekicks, or penalties.

During ball placement the same rules apply as in Stop state. The only exception is that robots of one team are allowed to approach the ball, according to the team that is mentioned in the BallPlacement state.

The ball is considered placed successfully if the following conditions apply:

 no more than 15 seconds passed since the placement command there is no robot within 50cm distance to the ball the ball is stationary the ball is at a position within 10cm radius from the requested position
This means that the robot has to move away from the ball once the team considers the ball placed correctly.

In the case of failure, the AutoRef will command the other team 
to place the ball. The team that receives the ball after the placement 
remains the same. 
If both teams fail to place the ball, Stop will be sent and the ball is 
placed by the human referee.

If a team has not implemented ball placement or fails AutoPlacement the third time in a half game,
 AutoPlacement is disabled for this team in the AutoRef software. In 
this case, the other team will receive the AutoPlacement request. If 
AutoPlacement is disable for both teams, the human ref places the ball 
at all times.

If the ball left the field surroundings (e.g. after a chip kick) or is not visible, the ball is always placed by the human ref.

Evaluation
The TC reserves the right to change the evaluation procedure.

Every team places the ball in the same situations. The number and
 kind of situations will be determined by the TC. The command will be 
issued and the teams have to place the ball in 15 seconds and move away 
from the ball. 

A point will be awarded for every successfully placed ball. The  points will be normalized and merged with the 11 vs. 11 Technical  challenge. 

11v11 Mixed Team Challenge

The 11 on 11 Technical challenge is a full match between two teams of
 up to 11 robots, each composed of robots from two different SSL teams 
(here referred to as sub-teams). Each robot must be controlled by its 
originating sub-team’s software. Sub-team pairings will rotate so that 
each team plays with all possible partner teams.

Communication
Communication between the two sub-teams of a team is allowed, according to the following specifications:

 Messages are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf to port 10012. Sub-teams communicate only a rough plan for each of their robots using the TeamPlan message specified by the multi_team_communication.proto Google protobuf:
 package multi_team_comm;
 //Protocol to communicate rough plans to other teammates
 //Units are specified as follows:
 //length - millimeters
 //time - seconds
 //angle - radians
 
 //Plan of a list of robots
 message TeamPlan {
   repeated RobotPlan plans = 1;
 }
 
 //Plan of a single robot
 message RobotPlan {
   //ID of the robot from SSL vision
   required uint32 robot_id = 1;
   //Role that this robot is assuming
   // 0 - no specified role
   // 1 - goalie
   // 2 - defense
   // 3 - offense
   optional int32 role = 2;
   //Planned navigation target
   optional Pose nav_target = 3;
   //Planned shot target
   optional Location shot_target = 4;
 }
 
 // Location message, in mm. The center of the field is specified as (0, 0).
 // Positive x axis points to the opponent's goal
 message Location {
   required int32 x = 1;
   required int32 y = 2;
 }
 
 message Pose {
   //location of the robot
   optional Location loc = 1;
   //heading of the robot
   optional float heading = 2;
 };

Rules
Standard SSL rules apply to mixed team games with the following additions:

 A mixed team is formed from robots of two sub-teams. The maximum robot number is increased to 11 per mixed team. Each 
sub-team may have only a maximum of 5 players on the field at any time. 
Each sub-team may additionally provide a goalkeeper for one period. The 
goal keeper for the second period must not be provided by the same 
sub-team that provided the goalkeeper for the first period. Goals are only valid if robots from both of the two sub-teams 
forming a mixed team have touched the ball since the last stoppage of 
play. The robots must be able to submit to a speed limit imposed by the 
referee, subject to change during the game due to safety concerns. Teams
 will be allowed to touch their computers for up to a minute if the 
speed limit is changed; this time will be used exclusively to change the
 speed configuration as requested.
Field Setup
The size of the field will be approximately 13.4 meters by 9 meters, as shown below.

For the quad-size field setup, a total of eight cameras will be used, with two
separate computers running ssl-vision. 
The coordinate system, and camera layout will be as shown in the following
figure:

Computer 0 will run process images from cameras 0-3, and computer 1 will process images from cameras 4-7. On ssl-vision on computer 0, cameras 4-7 will be enumerated, but not running. On ssl-vision on computer 1, cameras 0-3 will be enumerated, but not running. Both computers will publish their data to the standard ssl-vision UDP multicast and port, 224.5.23.2:10006 
The quad-size-field branch of SSL-Vision has been pre-configured to the coordinate system and camera assignment for the quad-size field.

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2013.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committes encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Until May 31st, teams interested in participating in any of the challenges need to announce their interest to the Organizing Committee . This is necessary for the preparation of the schedules. Please state in which challenges your team is planning to participate.
Shooting Challenge
This challenge will test the team’s shooting accuracy and ability to score a goal against four slowly moving defenders and one goal keeper. The task is to score from seven fixed positions in the field of play as depicted in the image below. The aim of this challenge is to score as many goals as possible.
Each team is allowed to have a single robot on the field of play during the challenge.The exact ball positions might be subject of change.The balls are placed one by one by the referee.For each ball position a “direct freekick” command is issued by the referee box. After the shot has been completed a “stop” signal will be sent and the next ball is placed.During ball placement a “halt” signal might be sent due to vision interference. Robots need to adhere to the “halt” signal and stop moving.The standard rules for the execution of a direct freekick apply, e.g., no double touch and lack of progress. During stop mode the robot needs to keep distance.Four defenders will move slowly along the outside of the defense area. The goal keeper will move slowly between the goal posts.Own goals by the slowly moving defenders or goalie are not counted.It is not allowed to interfere with the defenders or goal keeper. If the attacker contacts any of the defenders or the goal keeper, the number of goals is reduced by one.
Each team will have a single turn. Each ball position will be used twice. Therefore, a maximum of 14 goals can be achieved.
Each team is allowed to cancel the turn and restart the challenge once. The turn may be cancelled only before the last shot has been taken.
Navigation Challenge
Three robots have to navigate through a dozen of static obstacles from the left side of the field to the right side of the field, while crossing the center point of the field. The obstacles are randomly distributed in the center of the field. The goal is to reach the target positions as fast as possible.
Obstacles are randomly scattered in a virtual circle around the center of the field of play. It will be ensured that at least one path with the width of at least two robot diameters will exist through the obstacles to the center of the field from each side of the field. Examples of possible routes are depicted in the image below as lines with arrows. It does not matter which particular robot fills each target position.Teams will not be allowed to test with the final obstacle configuration before the technical challenge.Each team needs to have three robots navigating through the field, placed in each corner (corner kick position) and the penalty point as shown in the image below. Blue points are starting positions and yellow points are targets.All robots have to reach the center of field (indicated in violet in the image below) before reaching their target, such that a successful pass is recorded. If a robot moves to the target position without reaching the center of the field, a successful pass is not counted until the robot moves to the center of the field first and then moves back to its target position.Each collision with an obstacle will result in a time penalty of 5 seconds.Each collision with another robot will result in a time penalty of 7 seconds.Pushing or substantially dislocating an obstacle will result in a time penalty of 10 seconds.To begin the challenge a “force start” signal will be sent from the referee box and the clock is started.The clock will be stopped once the last robot as reached its final target and stopped moving. It is understood that the target position and center point might not be reached exactly due to vision noise. An error of 5cm is considered to be sufficient for this challenge.
Each team has two tries, and the best time is recorded as the final result.

CONTENT:
In 2010, we have two technical challenges. These two challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop interesting technical contributions. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge are more likely to benefit from their work. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed from their respective 2009 versions. All challenges must use the new SSL Shared Vision system and the new standard robot pattern.
Until June 4th (two weeks before the start of the competition), each team that is interested in participating in the challenge has to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.
Mixed Team Challenge – Shooting and Passing
One of the aims of the Small Size League is to foster the development of cooperating agents. The current state of the art is to control all members of one team by a central intelligence instance which has a complete knowledge about the current state of each robot. Even in teams which have a distributed artificial intelligence component, every robot has detailed information about the behaviours of its team members and thus can deduce actions which lead to an overall cooperative behaviour of the whole team. The aim of this challenge is to define a scenario for “real” cooperation, i.e. to let robots cooperate which do not have any knowledge about the internal state of all other robots of their team. This is intended to become realized by mixing existing teams.
A mixed team is defined:
For the 2010 challenge, we consider a mixed team as a team of four robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each of these two sub-teams has to provide two robots. Each sub-team controls their robots with their own software stack. Of course, all members of a mixed team have the same team marker colour. For this year, there will not be any communication between the different sub-teams. A mixed team must use the new SSL Shared Vision system and the new standard robot pattern.
For creating the mixed teams, the following approach will be applied:
After the round robin stage of the soccer competition (i.e. on Tuesday afternoon), the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” are separated into two groups. In both groups, every team has to pair with every other team and perform the challenge task. The two best teams from each group will process to the final round according to their score. These teams have to pair with every other team and perform the challenge task again. The total ranking of the challenge can be determined as follows:
The first four teams are ranked by only the number of goals they scored in the final round.The remaining teams are ranked by the number of goals their scored.
The Challenge
Put up two robots from each different teams on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after two robots from different teams have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass*)2 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes*)
*A pass will only be considering as valid if it has involved robots originating from two different teams.
The rules for this challenge:
To start, the mixed team chooses a side of the field. All robots must be placed within 1m from their team’s goal line. Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles. A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the mixed team’s own side of the field. A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half. Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.

Open Challenge
This challenge is designed to encourage creativity within the Small-Size League, allowing teams to demonstrate interesting research on autonomous mobile robot systems. Each team will demonstrate their research on a standard Small Size League 2010 field, and has to use one or more Small Size League robot(s) as part of the demonstration. In this open challenge, hardware modifications or extensions to the small size robot(s) are acceptable, even if not fully compliant to the standard SSL game rules, as long as the demonstration poses no risk to the people, the field, or the equipment. Teams may use the SSL-Vision system that is provided. Teams are not allowed to mount any additional equipment to the overhead camera bar. Teams can demonstrate their open challenge topics as much as they like within three minute. Each team may also distribute a short presentation or a page of a paper to describe their research. The winner will be decided by a vote from SSL team leaders using a Barda count. Each team will list their top 10 teams in order (excluding themselves). The teams are encouraged to evaluate the performance based on these criteria: Technical strength, novelty, expected impact, and relevance to the league. The time of vote will be within 30 minutes after the last demonstration. Each ranking from each team is converted to points: 10 points for top ranking, 9 points for second, down to 1 point for 10th. Any points awarded by a team to itself will be disregarded. The points awarded by the teams are summed. The team with the highest total score will be the winner of this challenge.
Overall Challenge Ranking
The results from two challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let MIXED_1_SUM be the sum of all points in a group that all teams in a group received in the first round of the mixed team challenge, MIX_2_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the final round of the mixed team challenge, MIXED_1_TEAM be the number of points a single team received in the first round and MIXED_2_TEAM be the number of points a single team received in the final round.
Let OPEN_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in open challenge and OPEN_TEAM be the number of points a single team received.
Then
TOTAL_TEAM = ( (MIXED_1_TEAM / MIXED_1_SUM) + (MIX_2_TEAM / MIXED_2_SUM) )/2 + OPEN_TEAM / OPEN_SUM
Time and Fields
The challenge will be conducted during the first and second days in the competition.
Optional Game Demo
If some teams volunteer to show a mixed full 5 vs. 5 SSL soccer match, we would strongly appreciate and support this. Nevertheless, this will not be considered for the overall challenge ranking.

* All deadlines are by the end of the day at any place on Earth

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by January 29th, 2019:
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video.Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2019 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:Team NameCountryUniversityMain contact name and emailWebsite (if you have one)Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)Short rationale for the preferred division
Please pay attention to the following points:
Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at http://conferences.cs.umass.edu/robocup-ssl-2019
Every team can register and upload their qualification materials to the site.
- Registration: Main page, select " I'm a new user and want to create an account"
- Submission: After logging in, click on "Start new paper" (https://conferences.cs.umass.edu/robocup-ssl-2019/paper/new)
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):
A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. The game should be based on contemporary rules (2011 and afterwards).A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:
Subject: 2019 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.The URL of your video, which must be available via FTP or HTTP.
Please pay attention to the following:
Please submit a single video file.The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Field Configuration

The RoboCup 2018 will feature 3 fields.
Field A: 9x12m, used for official games of division AField B: 6x9m, used for official games of division BField C: 6x9m, used for testing (both divisions)
The time before the scheduled start of official games is reserved for the two opposing teams of the next match. If there is no time left between the end of a match and the scheduled start of the next match, testing time on the playing field cannot be granted.
On field C, testing time slots will be distributed by the OC. There will be three options:
One team can use the field as a half of a division A field (there will be a large goal as well)One team can use it as a full-size division B fieldTwo teams can use it simultaneously as a half of a division B field
After all games of the day have finished, all teams are free to test on either field. If there is too much demand, the OC will also coordinate it.

Tournament Format

Division A
Teams in division A will play a round robin group stage followed by a double elimination playoff stage.There are two groups, with 5 and 4 teamsThe team that places first or second the group starts in the upper bracketThe other teams start in the lower bracketNo team drops out after the group stage
Group Stage
Every group consists of three teams from pool 1 and one or two teams from pool 2The pools were decided using the results of previous official tournamentsThe rule that there is no more than 1 team from the same country in the same group will not be usedThe groups will be assigned using the SSL grouping tool and random.org

Dear SSL-community,as
 most of you should already know by now, we use to publish all our work 
each year during or after each RoboCup since we first participated in 
2011.And we 
continue with this attitude, because we belief in the importance of 
sharing knowledge to advance our league and the RoboCup.Below,
 you will find a list of our publications and a list of the most 
significant changes. The documentation or description is included within
 the individual packages.
Mechanics–
 Modified the curved front shape of the straight kicking plunger. This 
significantly reduced the spread of kicked balls when they are not 
perfectly at the center in front of the robot.- Enlarged the 
infrared barrier PCBs on the sides of the dribbling device to prevent 
the silicon rubbers of the linear damping mechanism to fall out 
seldomly.Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Mechanics-2018.zipElectronics– Usage of a new wireless module: Semtech SX1280-
 Schematics and PCB layout of a tiny 34x18mm module with a single SX1280
 module. Pin-compatible with most nRF24L01+ breakout boards on the 
market (SX1280.pdf).- Schematics and PCB layout of a 
completely new base station using one SX1280 module and the SKY66112 
front-end module for enhanced output power and antenna switching. 
Features network connectivity and a 5″ touchscreen with 800×480 pixels.Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Electronics-2018.zipFirmware– Support for the SX1280 and SKY66112 modules (in base station and mainboard code).- Enhanced wireless transfer protocol to make best use of the new modules.- Adaption of the base station code to the new hardware (incl. completely new user interface).- Base station touchscreen supports manual control of a single robot for demonstration purposes.- Base station can be configured via touchscreen.-
 New feature: Asynchronous Bang-Bang trajectories. They are 
intentionally not synchronized on the X and Y trajectory to reach a 
specific line/direction faster.- Major update of robot 
controller and sensor fusion. The robot now uses a state space 
controller with acceleration output and model-based friction 
compensation when a position source (e.g. SSL Vision) is available. If not position source
 is available, local velocity output is used with a velocity-error 
correction for encoder readings. All models are derived from empirical 
data.Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Firmware-2018.zipSoftware (TIGERs AutoRef)– Detect more rule violations- Updated to new rules- Significantly improved ball speed detection and chip kick detection (see Vision Filter)Code: https://gitlab.tigers-mannheim.de/open-source/AutoRefereeSoftware (AI)– Enhanced the integrated AutoRef for full automatic simulation of two teams playing against each other- Offensive Action Trees for self learning offensive behaviors (see ETDP)- Multiple new supportive behaviors for supporting the attacker- Improved the selection of the best suited attacker that should handle the ball- Improved the skills that handle the ball, like kicking, receiving, redirecting, approaching and catching- Integrated new asynchronous bang bang trajectories into multiple skills- More robust path planning with ahead-of-time emergency brakeRelease: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gzSoftware (Vision Filter)–
 New chip kick model: We are now using fixed restitution coefficients 
for all hops in Z direction, for the first hop in XY direction, and for 
all further hops in XY direction (3 parameters in total).- Online straight kick and chip kick estimation has been updated to use a direct simplex-based optimization method.- Chip kick estimation can now optimize a complete trajectory, not only two hops.-
 An additional optimizer can estimate all model parameters for a 
straight and chip kick with an evolutionary algorithm (CMAES). Model 
parameters can now be fully calculated within Sumatra, no further 
external software required.- The Vision Filter is completey integrated into our official AutoRef software.- Kick information from  our own robots is now used as a-priori knowledge for estimation.-
 The viewport architect, which aligns the viewports of the different 
cameras and tries to minimize overlap, now supports different modes of 
how the viewports are calculated. Based on field size, camera positions,
 camera projections, or dynamically on detected robot positions.-
 Correction of inbound SSL Vision timestamps. The average rate of each 
camera is estimated and the timestamps are corrected for each camera, 
mitigating network and processing delays. This increases filter accuracy
 for ball and robots.Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gzSoftware (status-board)–
 A new application for visualizing referee information during a game 
including new game events that are announced by the autoRefs.- Additionally, a live view of the field.Code: https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-status-board-clientApplication is available here (and will so during the RoboCup): https://tigers-mannheim.de/status-board/Looking forward to seeing you all in Montreal 🙂CheersTIGERs Mannheim

Dear SSL community,
This year RoboJackets has started outsourcing our mechanical designs. Additionally, we are continuing our tradition of open sourcing our software, firmware, and PCB designs through GitHub. This year we have added a new project: A fully open source microcontroller
 board based on the Cortex M7 with an emphasis on being small enough to easily fit within small size league robots.

CONTENT:
In 2008, we will have a challenge setup similar to 2007. There will be two challenges to compare technical abilities needed for successfully playing robot soccer. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate almost without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge will probably benefit from their work.
Challenge 1 – Shooting and Passing
Put up to three robots on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after only one robot has touched the ball2 Points: Scoring a goal after two robots have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass)3 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes)
The rules for this challenge:
To start, all robots must be placed within 1m from the own goal line.Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles.A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the own side of the field.A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half.Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
Challenge 2 – Navigation
Two sets of obstacles (see attached sketch) are placed at each side of the field. One robot starts at the center of the field and must drive from one penalty mark of the field to the other as many times as possible within 120s. Every lap (from one set of obstacles to the other and back) counts as one point. Each time it has to drive through the gap between two obstacles. If it touches an obstacle, it gets a penalty of -1 points.
Additionally, teams are allowed to use up to three robots in parallel and sum up their laps. If two robots touch each other, the penalty also applies (per touching event, not per robot, of course).
If a robot has driven at least one lap (independently of the number of collisions), the team’s minimum number of points will be 1.
The red line indicates an example trajectory of a robot performing this challenge.
Challenges – Overall Ranking
The results from both challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let BALL_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the ball challenge and BALL_TEAM the number of points a single team received. Assume the same for the navigation challenge (NAV_*).
Then TOTAL_TEAM = BALL_TEAM / BALL_SUM + NAV_TEAM / NAV_SUM

Chip Kick Interception

The goal of this challenge is to detect and intercept chip kicks based on SSL Vision data.

Procedure
A chip kick is performed from 3 different locations by an opponent robot:

 From a corner to the center of the field From a corner along the long side of the field From the goal to the center
At each location, 4 kicks of different distances are performed.
These distances are 2m, 2.5m, 3m and 3.5m in random order.

A participating team places one robot on the field. The task is to touch the ball
before or shortly after it hits the ground for the first time. This shall imitate the defense problem when the opponent
plays chip kicks.

A participating team has to publish its software which is responsible for detecting chip kicks
and reconstructing the flight trajectory.

Score
Each successfull interception (i.e. the participating robot touches the ball before it hits the ground a second time) gives 3 points. If the ball is kicked instead of simply touched, 1 extra point will be awarded. If the ball is kicked into a goal, 1 further extra point will be awarded. This gives a total number of 60 possible points. 

Multi-Team Communication

The purpose of this challenge is an implementation demonstration of the SSL multi-team communication protocol.
Therefore, two participating teams perform various collaborative tasks using this protocol.
The mixed team has 15 seconds to accomplish each task.
This challenge assumes a simple master-slave relationship between the two collaborating teams.
This is, the master team sends a team plan to the slave team, which acts according to this plan.
In order to evaluate the behavior in accordance to the team plan, the master team
sends the team plan to an evaluator computer (run by the TC). This computer forwards
the team plan to the slave team.

Initial situation for each task
The referee command before the actual tasks is Stop. The robots of both teams
have to be located within 1 meter distance to the middle line between the two goals.
The goalie has to be located in the defense are and has to remain there during all tasks.

Task 1
This task
 is signaled by a GameForce referee command.
All defenders have to move to the own goal, all attackers to the 
opponent goal. Every robot of the joint team except for the goalie
must be assigned either a Defense or Offense RobotRole.
There have to be at least 2 defenders and 2 attackers.
The task is fulfilled when all robots are located within 2 meter 
distance to the particular goal’s center, but not inside the defense or 
attack area.

Task 2
This task is signaled by an Indirect Freekick command for the opponent team (which
is not present at the field).

9 defenders have to be located with less than 10 centimeters distance to the defense area, but
not occupying or touching the defense area. The master team should prescribe the target positions
in order to avoid positioning conflicts.

Task 3
This task is signaled by an Indirect Freekick command for the mixed team.

The master team chooses one of the partner team’s robots and 
plays a pass to this robot. The task is fulfilled
if no other than this robot and the kicker of the freekick touched the 
ball
before it entered the opponent’s goal. The chosen robot of the Slave 
team is indicated
by sending a shot_target to this (and only this) robot in its RobotPlan.
If the ball leaves the field without scoring a goal, or if another robot
 than the two mentioned touched the ball, no points are scored.

Score
Each 
successfully accomplished task gives an 5 points, remaining seconds are 
added up as points. Both teams receive the same amount of points.
This gives a total number of 60 possible points.

The best 4 scoring teams will be qualified to compete in the Mixed Team Challenge.

ZJUNlict
Dear SSL community,
As you may already know, we have open-sourced our electronics in January. Besides that, we would also like to share our mechanical design and vision process software. We hope these can help the SSL community. Detailed design specification and software guide can be found in the corresponding github repository listed below. 
Mechanics (Include 3D Design Files)
https://github.com/ZJUNlict/Mechanics
The mechanical design emphasizes on crash protection, maintainability and simplicity. The dribbler design is thoroughly explained. 
Electronics (Include Schematics, PCBs and Related Firmware)
https://github.com/ZJUNlict/Electronics
The design files are up-to-date. We also present the transition of design from 2012 to 2019 which may provide other teams a practical way to progress.
Software (mAn – Vision Process and GUI)
https://github.com/ZJUNlict/mAn
mAn is the main GUI of ZJUNlict. It also processes the vision and referee information (protobuf messages). 
Looking forward to see you all in Sydney!
Best wishes,
ZJUNlict

DOCUMENT 436
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2015/robocup-2015-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
Two technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2015. These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committees encourage all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
11-vs-11 Mixed Team Challenge
The 11 on 11 Technical challenge is a full match between two teams of up to 11 robots, each composed of robots from two different SSL teams (here referred to as sub-teams). Each robot must be controlled by its originating sub-team’s software. Sub-team pairings will be randomly drawn. The winners will be determined based on the number of valid goals scored.
Communication
Communication between the two sub-teams of a team is allowed, according to the following specifications:
Messages are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf to port 10012.Sub-teams communicate only a rough plan for each of their robots using the TeamPlan message specified by the multi_team_communication.proto Google protobuf:
 package multi_team_comm;
 //Protocol to communicate rough plans to other teammates
 //Units are specified as follows:
 //length - millimeters
 //time - seconds
 //angle - radians
 
 //Plan of a list of robots
 message TeamPlan {
   repeated RobotPlan plans = 1;
 }
 
 //Plan of a single robot
 message RobotPlan {
   //ID of the robot from SSL vision
   required uint32 robot_id = 1;
   //Role that this robot is assuming
   // 0 - no specified role
   // 1 - goalie
   // 2 - defense
   // 3 - offense
   optional int32 role = 2;
   //Planned navigation target
   optional Pose nav_target = 3;
   //Planned shot target
   optional Location shot_target = 4;
 }
 
 // Location message, in mm. The center of the field is specified as (0, 0).
 // Positive x axis points to the opponent's goal
 message Location {
   required int32 x = 1;
   required int32 y = 2;
 }
 
 message Pose {
   //location of the robot
   optional Location loc = 1;
   //heading of the robot
   optional float heading = 2;
 };

Rules
Standard SSL rules apply to mixed team games with the following additions:
A mixed team is formed from robots of two sub-teams.The maximum robot number is increased to 11 per mixed team. Each sub-team may have only a maximum of 5 players on the field at any time. Each sub-team may additionally provide a goalkeeper for one period. The goal keeper for the second period must not be provided by the same sub-team that provided the goalkeeper for the first period.Goals are only valid if robots from both of the two sub-teams forming a mixed team have touched the ball since the last stoppage of play.
Shared Radio Protocol Challenge
Overview
The goal of the shared radio protocol is to demonstrate teams playing soccer using other teams’ robots. This will allow (for example) teams of heterogeneous hardware, or mixed teams with one team’s software and another’s hardware.
For this technical challenge, the team that provides the robot hardware will be called the Radio Server Team (RST), and the team that controls the robots via software will be called the Radio Client Team (RCT). The RST will run a server that accepts data on the UDP port number 10010, receives the radio commands in the specified protobuf format, and send the commands over their own radio to the robots. The RCT will run the control software that will send radio commands in the specified protobuf format to the UDP port 10010 of the RST. This setup is depicted in the following figure:
Radio Protocol
The radio commands are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf, with the following protobuf definitions. Each wrapper packet contains multiple radio commands, for each of the robots to be controlled.
message RadioProtocolWrapper {
  repeated RadioProtocolCommand command = 1;
}

message RadioProtocolCommand {
  // The unique ID of the robot, as identified by SSL-Vision.
  required int32 robot_id = 1;

  // Desired forward drive velocity in meters / second.
  required float velocity_x = 2;

  // Desired sideways left drive velocity in meters / second.
  required float velocity_y = 3;

  // Desired counterclockwise angular velocity in radians / second.
  required float velocity_r = 4;

  // Desired flat kick speed, in meters / second.
  // If this optional field is missing, then no flat kick command should be
  // sent.
  optional float flat_kick = 5;

  // Desired chip kick distance, in meters.
  // If this optional field is missing, then no flat kick command should be
  // sent. If this field is present along with the flat_kick field, the
  // flat_kick command takes precedence.
  optional float chip_kick = 6;

  // Desired dribbler spin, from -1 to +1, where -1 is the maximum reverse-spin
  // that can be imparted to the ball, and +1 is the maximum forward-spin
  // that can be imparted to the ball.
  optional float dribbler_spin = 7;
}

Source Code
Source code for the defined protobufs, and sample RST and RCT executables, is available on GitHub.
Scoring
Both teams, the RST and the RCT are awarded the specified number of points each for every skill from the following list that they perform:
Driving a single robot in a straight line along the length of the field twice, from touching one goal line to the other goal line at the other end of the field, and back, along the middle of the field (1 point)Intercepting a moving ball travelling at ≥ 1 m/s, and bringing it to a stop. (1 point)Scoring a goal against a stopped defence consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders (1 point)Scoring a goal against a stopped defence consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders by a one-touch (deflection) kick of a moving ball travelling at ≥ 1 m/s. (2 points)Scoring a goal on the stopped defence after a pass between two robots (2 points).Scoring a goal on a moving 3-robot defence after a pass between two robots (2 points).
The skills will be evaluated as follows:
For skills involving moving balls, the ball will be rolled in by a human from the goal line towards the center of the field.For the skills involving scoring goals, the trials are started from game off state with the ball at the center of the field.For direct goal scoring, a force start referee command will be sent. For indirect goal scoring with passes, an indirect free kick referee command will be sent.Points are scored only once per skill. No additional points are awarded for repeating a skill, either to the RST, or RCT, with the same, or any other RST-RCT pairing.The RST team will be monitoring the computer, commands sent, and the robots, and may, at their discretion, abort the communication and end the trial at any time.The RCT and RST must both take appropriate precautions to maintain safety of the robots, and are expected to partake in the challenge in fair spirit. The RCT will not be held liable for any possible damage to the RST’s robots.
Procedure
Order of the challenge demonstrations, and pairings: [To Be Determined]

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by January 21st, 2020:
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video (see instructions below).Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2020 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:Team NameCountryUniversityMain contact name and emailWebsite (if you have one)Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)Short rationale for the preferred division
Please pay attention to the following points:
Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.There are two divisions with separate tournaments: division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The teams may choose the division they want to play in, but the OC will have the final word.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every division B team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) and every division A team an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2020. 
To create an account, click on “Register”, next to the “New to CMT?” text. To submit a paper, click on the top left button “Create a new submission”.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage and be under 2 minutes long. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):
A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup game or one of the local regional competitions. The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill.A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:
Subject: 2020 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.The URL of your video, which must be available via FTP or HTTP.
Please pay attention to the following:
Please submit a single video file.The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Team Poster

 Every team must bring a poster to the RoboCup competition that illustrates the content of the (E)TDP. The poster  must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in  the RoboCup venue for everyone to see and read.

CONTENT:
In 2009, we have two basic technical challenges, similar to 2008. These two basic challenges are intended to compare technical abilities needed for successfully playing robot soccer. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate almost without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge will probably benefit from their work. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed slightly from their respective 2008 versions.
Additionally to the two basic challenges, we have an enhanced Challenge for Mixed Team Play which will also involve the usage of the new SSL Shared Vision System.
Basic Challenge 1 – Shooting and Passing
Put up two to three robots on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after two robots have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass)2 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes)
The rules for this challenge:
To start, all robots must be placed within 1m from the own goal line.Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles.A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the own side of the field.A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half.Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
Basic Challenge 2 – Navigation
Two sets of obstacles (all within 180mm diameter and marked with a standard blue or yellow center marker) are placed at each side of the field, at the approximate initial coordinates as shown in the attached sketch. One robot starts at the center of the field and must drive from one penalty mark of the field to the other as many times as possible within 120s. It must do so by alternating the side of entry between the two sets of obstacles, thus effectively driving a figure-eight. Every successful lap (from one set of obstacles to the other and back, while maintaining the figure-eight requirement) counts as one point. If it touches an obstacle, it gets a penalty of -1 points. Note, that the positions of the obstacles can change slightly during the execution of this challenge (e.g. by a robot bumping into them, or by a human repositioning them), so your system should accomodate for that.
Additionally, teams are allowed to use up to three robots in parallel and sum up their laps. If two robots touch each other, the penalty also applies (per touching event, not per robot, of course).
If a robot has driven at least one lap (independently of the number of collisions), the team’s minimum number of points will be 1.
The red line indicates an example trajectory of a robot performing this challenge.
Mixed Team Challenge
One of the aims of the Small Size League is to foster the development of cooperating agents. The current state of the art is to control all members of one team by a central intelligence instance which has a complete knowledge about the current state of each robot. Even in teams which have a distributed artificial intelligence component, every robot has detailed information about the behaviours of its team members and thus can deduce own actions which lead to an overall cooperative behaviour of the whole team. The aim of this challenge is to define a scenario for “real” cooperation, i.e. to let robots cooperate which do not have any knowledge about the internal state of all other robots of their team. This is intended to become realized by mixing existing teams which then have to accomplish a modified version of the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”.
Mixing Teams
First of all, a mixed team needs to be defined:
For the 2009 challenge, we consider a mixed team as a team of four robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each of these two sub-teams has to provide two robots. Every robot is controlled by its own software stack. Of course, all members of a mixed team have the same team marker colour. For this year, there will not be any communication between the different sub-teams. A mixed team must use the new SSL Shared Vision system.
As procedure for creating the mixed teams, the following approach will be applied:
Until June 17th (two weeks before the start of the competition), each team that is interested in participating in the challenge has to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.Every team that intends to participate in the mixed team challenge has to successfully participate in the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”, i.e. to score at least three points. This is necessary to assure a minimum level of passing skills.After the round robin stage of the soccer competition (i.e. on Friday afternoon), the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” become generated semi-randomly. Since there are several field assignment constraints for the finals (see section about “Time and Fields”) not every pair of teams is reasonable from an organizational point of view.
The Challenge
The task to accomplish is almost identical to the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”. Except the different number of robots (exactly four instead of up to three), the only difference is the scoring scheme: A pass will only be considering as valid if it has involved robots originating from two different teams.
Time and Fields
The challenge will be conducted during the two final days. Among the finals and the Humanoid Small Size demonstrations, there will be – especially on Sunday – enough free time slots. These slots will become assigned dynamically on site. There will be four SSL fields at the competition site. One of these fields will be used for Humanoid Small Size demonstrations during the weekend. Two others (on Sunday only one) are needed for official games. The remaining field can be used exclusively for the challenge. The two game fields can also be used (e.g. by those teams still participating in the competition) but only in a way that minimally disturbs the preparations for the official games.
Optional Game Demo
If some teams volunteer to show a mixed full 5 vs. 5 SSL soccer match, we would strongly appreciate and support this. Nevertheless, this will not be considered for the overall challenge ranking.
Overall Challenge Ranking
The results from the three challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let BALL_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the ball challenge and BALL_TEAM the number of points a single team received. Assume the same for the other two challenge (NAV_* and MIXED_* respectively).
Then TOTAL_TEAM = BALL_TEAM / BALL_SUM + NAV_TEAM / NAV_SUM + MIXED_TEAM / MIXED_SUM

CONTENT:
Three technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2014, out of which the Double-Size Field technical challenge is compulsory for teams to proceed beyond the round-robins.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committees encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Double-Size Field Challenge
For a team to qualify beyond the round robins, they must successfully participate in the double-sized field technical challenge. Successful participation is declared after scoring at least 2 points. Points will be awarded for the demonstrating the following skills on the double-sized field, where each skill is scored only once:
Taking a kickoff without a force-start (1 point).Scoring a goal against a stopped defense consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders (1 point).Taking an indirect free kick from the goal line without a force start (1 point).Scoring a goal on the stopped defense after a pass between two robots (2 points).Scoring a goal on a moving 3-robot defense after a pass between two robots (4 points).
In addition to these points, additional bonus points will be awarded to teams that play on the double-sized field for actual competition matches:
You get 4 bonus points if you played at least 1 game on the double sized field.For every goal scored in your best (highest scoring) double sized field game you get 3 bonus points. This includes goals from penalty kicks.
Procedure for the Double-Sized Technical Challenge:
The challenge starts with a kickoff.If the team successfully scores a point from the kickoff, the challenge continues according to the normal rules of the game, except all free kicks are awarded to the playing team.If the team is unsuccessful at scoring a point from the kickoff, they may request another kickoff in lieu of a free kick the next time the ball goes out of play.The challenge concludes at either the 5-minute time, or when the team withdraws after scoring at least 2 points.
Automatic Referee Challenge
This challenge will test the accuracy of a team’s autonomous referee software. Software entered in this challenge does not need to be capable of autonomously running an entire game; rather, the intent of this technical challenge is to demonstrate building blocks and provide a solid foundation on which others can build more advanced autonomous referee systems.
A team will be awarded the specified number of points after the software correctly identifies the specified event for the third time (no further points are awarded for additional detections, nor for two or fewer detections of a particular event):
The ball has exited the field, and which team most recently touched it: 1 pointThe RoboCup 2014 rule regarding multiple defenders in the defence area is violated, by which team, and to which extent (partial or full occupation): 1 pointRobots have collided violently, and which team was at fault: 2 pointsThe ball was kicked above 8 m/s, and by which team: 1 pointThe ball was kicked above 15 cm above the field surface and crossed the midfield line before bouncing or touching another robot (a new penalty at RoboCup 2014 defined in section 12.3), and which team last touched the ball before the violation: 2 pointsOne robot is pushing another without the robots first colliding violently, and which robot is pushing: 6 points
Any software that identifies one of the above events when it did not, in fact, occur will lose one point per false positive identification.
To participate in this challenge, all autonomous referees must be designed to receive SSL-Vision and referee box packets from the network to identify game state, and must be configured to avoid sending any packets onto the network.
To avoid any unfair benefit, all participants will simultaneously judge a single live RoboCup game. All autonomous referees will be attached to the field network. A neutral third party will monitor each autonomous referee computer’s display; teams are responsible for making their autonomous referee software easy enough to explain to this third party. Please consider the use of a scrolling log format (this could be as simple as writing messages to standard output), for ease of reading and re-examination of past output. The neutral third party will record each instance of an event identified by the autonomous referee, along with whether the positive identification was true or false.
For the purposes of this technical challenge, a positive identification is considered true if and only if the human referee on duty at the game makes the same call. As the purpose of this challenge is to detect specific events, not to run a complete game, the referee will be requested to announce all relevant events, including those (s)he would not normally call due to e.g. the precedence rules or anticipated benefit rules set out in section 5.2 if the Laws of the Game. The referee will also be requested to consider input from his/her assistant when announcing these events, as some events may happen outside the referee’s line of sight.
In order to be declared as successfully participating in this technical challenge, a team’s autonomous referee software must:
execute for the duration of the game without human input, except that teams are permitted to work on their referee software during half-time and similar scheduled breaks in gameplay (but not during timeouts)have a score of at least two points when the game endshave its source code publicly available, under a license that could not reasonably prevent either other teams or the league from using the software or incorporating the code into their own autonomous referee systems (copyleft open-source licenses such as GPL are acceptable), along with any necessary documentation on compiling and running the software

Dear SSL-community,
as most of you should already know by now, we use to publish all our work each year during or after each RoboCup since we first participated in 2011.
And we continue with this attitude, because we belief in the importance of sharing knowledge to advance our league and the RoboCup.
Below, you will find a list of our publications and a list of the most significant changes. The documentation or description is included within the individual packages.
Mechanics
– Modified the curved front shape of the straight kicking plunger. This significantly reduced the spread of kicked balls when they are not perfectly at the center in front of the robot.
– Enlarged the infrared barrier PCBs on the sides of the dribbling device to prevent the silicon rubbers of the linear damping mechanism to fall out seldomly.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Mechanics-2018.zip
Electronics
– Usage of a new wireless module: Semtech SX1280
– Schematics and PCB layout of a tiny 34x18mm module with a single SX1280 module. Pin-compatible with most nRF24L01+ breakout boards on the market (SX1280.pdf).
– Schematics and PCB layout of a completely new base station using one SX1280 module and the SKY66112 front-end module for enhanced output power and antenna switching. Features network connectivity and a 5″ touchscreen with 800×480 pixels.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Electronics-2018.zip
Firmware
– Support for the SX1280 and SKY66112 modules (in base station and mainboard code).
– Enhanced wireless transfer protocol to make best use of the new modules.
– Adaption of the base station code to the new hardware (incl. completely new user interface).
– Base station touchscreen supports manual control of a single robot for demonstration purposes.
– Base station can be configured via touchscreen.
– New feature: Asynchronous Bang-Bang trajectories. They are intentionally not synchronized on the X and Y trajectory to reach a specific line/direction faster.
– Major update of robot controller and sensor fusion. The robot now uses a state space controller with acceleration output and model-based friction compensation when a position source (e.g. SSL Vision) is available. If not position source is available, local velocity output is used with a velocity-error correction for encoder readings. All models are derived from empirical data.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Firmware-2018.zip
Software (TIGERs AutoRef)
– Detect more rule violations
– Updated to new rules
– Significantly improved ball speed detection and chip kick detection (see Vision Filter)
Code: https://gitlab.tigers-mannheim.de/open-source/AutoReferee
Software (AI)
– Enhanced the integrated AutoRef for full automatic simulation of two teams playing against each other
– Offensive Action Trees for self learning offensive behaviors (see ETDP)
– Multiple new supportive behaviors for supporting the attacker
– Improved the selection of the best suited attacker that should handle the ball
– Improved the skills that handle the ball, like kicking, receiving, redirecting, approaching and catching
– Integrated new asynchronous bang bang trajectories into multiple skills
– More robust path planning with ahead-of-time emergency brakeRelease: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gz
Software (Vision Filter)
– New chip kick model: We are now using fixed restitution coefficients for all hops in Z direction, for the first hop in XY direction, and for all further hops in XY direction (3 parameters in total).
– Online straight kick and chip kick estimation has been updated to use a direct simplex-based optimization method.
– Chip kick estimation can now optimize a complete trajectory, not only two hops.
– An additional optimizer can estimate all model parameters for a straight and chip kick with an evolutionary algorithm (CMAES). Model parameters can now be fully calculated within Sumatra, no further external software required.
– The Vision Filter is completey integrated into our official AutoRef software.
– Kick information from  our own robots is now used as a-priori knowledge for estimation.
– The viewport architect, which aligns the viewports of the different cameras and tries to minimize overlap, now supports different modes of how the viewports are calculated. Based on field size, camera positions, camera projections, or dynamically on detected robot positions.
– Correction of inbound SSL Vision timestamps. The average rate of each camera is estimated and the timestamps are corrected for each camera, mitigating network and processing delays. This increases filter accuracy for ball and robots.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gz
Software (status-board)
– A new application for visualizing referee information during a game including new game events that are announced by the autoRefs.
– Additionally, a live view of the field.
Code: https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-status-board-client
Application is available here (and will so during the RoboCup): https://tigers-mannheim.de/status-board/
Looking forward to seeing you all in Montreal 🙂

Immortals
Dear SSL Community,
We would like to share our 3D-printed SSL robot designs with you. We think that our design can evolve with help from other community members to become the standard robot design for the SSL teams in the future.Since most teams are getting into the struggle of manufacturing a high number of robots to meet the new rules of the league, we thought it would be good to share this design with other teams so they can save time on the mechanical part of their projects.
In this work, we have made a great focus on 3D-printing technologies. Nowadays, 3D-printers, unlike CNC machines, are widely accessible to individuals and organizations. 
All mechanical documents of our design have been published and will be updated frequently.
The latest releases can be found here:

CONTENT:
At RoboCup 2021 there will be a virtual tournament without any hardware involved. It will be played with the latest rule set, except that division A and division B teams will play in the same tournament. If one of the playing teams wishes to play with division B rules, the match will be played with division B rules.
The infrastructure for this tournament will be provided by the RoboCup organizers. Teams are expected to run their software on a Linux system, likely minimal Ubuntu 20.04 inside a custom Docker container.
The setup and configuration for the competition is available on Github, so every team can test it beforehand.
The tournament is hosted at https://virtual.ssl.robocup.org/
Procedure
The primary referee will control the game and should start preparing the next match at least 5 min before the scheduled start time. If the primary refereeing team does not show up 5 minutes before the scheduled start time, the secondary refereeing team will take over the role of the primary referee and the GC operator.
If a team does not show up within 10 minutes after the scheduled starting time or if one team forfeits, the other team will play on an empty goal in the group stage and will automatically win in the elimination stage.
Before each match
Initialize the game-controller
Start a new game.Enter the correct team names.Make sure that both autoRefs are connected.Make sure that all game events for both autoRefs are set to Accept.Make sure that all game events for GC are set to Majority.
Retrieve information from both teams
The Match Preparation from the rules apply, expect for the following differences:
Determine one main contact person per team (which takes the role of the robot handler and is the only one allowed to talk with the referee)Ask teams if both agree to play with DivA rules, else switch to DivB in GC.Determine team colors (like described in the rules)Determine which team will have the first kickoff (by flipping a (virtual) coin) and enter it into the GC.Ask teams for their initial keeper ids and set the id in the GC.
Start the game at the scheduled start time or soon after, when all teams are ready
Ask if teams are ready.Hit STOP in the GC.The match should automatically start with a kickoff as soon as all robots are at valid positions.
After the match
Make sure that the game is switched to the “end of game” stage at the top. This will stop the automatic recording.Submit the results to https://scheduling.virtual.ssl.robocup.org/results.

The following Open Source Submissions were made by the teams via email.
TIGERs Mannheim – AudioRef
Dear SSL-Community,
As in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for the Open Source Award: The AudioRef!
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AudioRef
The AudioRef aims to improve the understanding of the current game state for referees, participants and spectators in an intuitive and immediate way. To achieve this the AudioRef awaits state changes, card changes, command changes and new game events in game controller packets and uses configurable sound packs to trigger appropriate acoustic signals like whistle sounds or voice shouts. The currently available English and German sound packs have been designed with a specific focus on conciseness, using an intuitive whistle pattern and trying not to describe the obvious. You’re welcome to contribute your own sound packs!
The AudioRef has already been used at two local competitions and German Open 2024. You can hear it in action in this video from the German Open tournament (with the German sound pack): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgTJf4Soo_w
and very likely at the upcoming RoboCup!
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curious, contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
ER-Force – Software Framework
Hello everyone,
ER-Force’s submission for this year’s Open Source Award is our framework (https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework). This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI.
It is able to

receive and process real life vision data
simulate SSL games in a full physics simulation
control robots
create game recordings and play them back
run strategies written in Lua and TypeScript
…and much more.

Best regards,
Christoph Schmidtmeier, ER-Force
Ri-one – Software Framework – RACOON-MW
Dear RoboCup SSL Teams,
Hello,
We are excited to submit our project “RACOON-MW” for this year’s Open Source Award.
Project Overview:SSL-RACOON-MW aggregates information from the Vision server and GameController and provides various useful information such as ball speed and robot speed together.For more details, please check out our GitHub repository:GitHub link: https://github.com/Rione/ssl-RACOON-MW
This software will be a perfect fit for new team: not only will it calculate your robot’s speed, slope, and intercept from Vision packets, but it will also identify your team and the opposing team using a game controller and a mode for simulators.These are then compiled and sent together in a single packet for your custom-made AI. This allows the team to focus on developing strategies!
We have included detailed usage instructions within the repository for your review. We hope this project will be beneficial to other teams as well.
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
Best regards,

Twente – TDP Search Engine V2
Dear RoboCuppers,
Once again, innovation and inspiration flows through the RoboCup. After last year’s successful Open Source competition with the Search Engine V1 , we’re ready to innovate once again! We would like to present the Search Engine V2! The project has received a complete overhaul. You can find it here https://tdpsearch.com/ . The new version supports the following additional features:

Ask ChatGPT directly through the Search Engine!
Papers from all leagues (over 600 and going up)
Improved search results with the help of AI (it’s magic)
Filter and search TDPs on leagues
Filter and search TDPs on year
It should not randomly break down anymore! (Thanks Azure)

Want to know how to onboard computer vision? BehRobot from the Humanoid Teen League already has figured this out. Is reinforcement learning useful? BadgerBots from the Soccer Standard Platform League can tell you. For robot-to-robot communication, ask Dagozilla from the Midsize League. And of course you can search through the latest papers from the SSL!
As a fun little extra, there is an image at the end of this mail containing a word cloud of the most used search terms up to now. If you want to know why Tigers is very much in there, here is a hint: “When in doubt, git clone Tigers” ~ Jorn, RoboTeam Twente
Best regards,
Emiel Steerneman – RoboTeam Twente

Immortals – AI software – Tyr
We are excited to submit our AI software, Tyr, for consideration in the open-source award category.
Tyr has been written from scratch for this year’s RoboCup, using parts of our old code with main focus on improving debug-ability and ease of development.
You can access the source code and documentation on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Immortals-Robotics/Tyr
Best regards,
Ali Salehi,
On behalf of Immortals
RobôCIn – Software Framework – ssl-core
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce ssl-core as our project submission for this year’s open-source competition. We hope it will contribute to the growth of our category at RoboCup.
ssl-core provides a framework for building distributed applications applied in the SSL environment that addresses the limitations of traditional monolithic software systems used in the category. The proposed approach is a microservice architecture that allows independent development and deployment in any technology, enhancing agility and reducing the risk of system-wide failures. 
To validate the system’s technologies, scope, and robustness, we developed the SSL VAR as an MVP of this repository aiming to use it in official competitions in the near future. SSL VAR provides real-time 3D visualization of the match (see figure below), as well as an analysis of past plays through replay at specific timestamps or events, such as fouls, penalties, or goals. 

To improve the separation of concerns within the system, the application’s GUI was detached from the core business logic handled by adopting a microfrontend architecture as a modern approach to building user interfaces. Thus, the microfrontend services can be separately deployed and accessed as a vision client, similar to the ssl-vision-client, but providing 3D visualization with the same functionalities as the complete proposed SSL VAR system.
Docker is the only dependency to run the SSL VAR.  To test in RoboCup, simply clone the repository and run:
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.robocup-2024-var.yaml up –build
For more information, visit our repository, we are always looking for enthusiastic contributors! Your contribution can make a big difference. Join our team and help us make the project even better! 
Best regards,
José Cruz, Matheus Teotonio, Uanderson Ricardo and Andresa Silva,
Software Infra Team, RobôCIn-INES.
luhbots soccer – Chipper with single coil for both chipping and kicking
Dear SSL Teams,
The luhbots soccer team is excited to submit our entry for the Open Source Award.
We present our innovative chipper, which utilizes a single coil for both chipping and kicking operations. This design offers several significant benefits:

Only one charge control circuit is required.
The simple design makes it easy for other teams to adopt.
It is an add-on to the original kicker, so no new design is needed. It can be adopted by teams currently limited to kicking.
Using a single, larger coil provides greater potential for design optimization.
Can be made entirely from 3D-printed parts.

You can find the repository with all design files here: https://github.com/luhsoccer/luhsoccer_chipper_2024Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
Best regards,Sebastian Knackstedtluhbots soccer

* All deadlines are by the end of the day at any place on Earth

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2024 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2024
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2024 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

CONTENT:
Technical Challenges of the Small Size League are intended to encourage teams to develop solutions to specific problems that will advance the quality of gameplay within the league. Teams are evaluated for their completion of the challenge during a designated time at RoboCup each year.
Rules
Below are the rules for the different RoboCup 2024 technical challenges. Source code associated with these challenges can be found on GitHub.
Black and White Hulls Challenge
Since many teams currently use black as their main hull color, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams during the game, this challenge aims to find a way to quickly change the hull color from black to white and back.
Black and White Hulls Challenge Rules (HTML)Black and White Hulls Challenge Rules (PDF)
Team vs Team Passing Challenge
This challenge is similar to the Chip Pass Challenge from 2023 and the Pass endurance Hardware Challenge from 2021, with the added twist that two teams compete against each other trying to complete as many passes as possible.

================================================================================

DOCUMENT 461
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/game-logs/
CONTENT:
The league attempts to create log files of all official matches during each RoboCup. They contain the timestamped ProtoBuf messages of ssl-vision, ssl-game-controller and vision-tracker producers like the autoRefs.
Software
The league provides multiple tools to deal with log files of SSL games:

ssl-logtools (C++): Original tooling with recorder and player
ssl-go-tools (Go): Set of CLI tools to record, play and analyze log files

The ssl-logtools can be considered legacy and are not maintained anymore. However, the ssl-go-tools do not provide a UI for the player yet.
File Format
Each log file starts with the following header:

1: String – File type (“SSL_LOG_FILE”) 2: Int32 – Log file format version 

Format version 1 encodes the protobuf messages in the following format:

1: Int64 – Receiver timestamp in ns 2: Int32 – Message type 3: Int32 – Size of binary protobuf message 4: String – Binary protobuf message 

The message types are:

MESSAGE_BLANK = 0 (ignore message)MESSAGE_UNKNOWN = 1 (try to guess message type by parsing the data)MESSAGE_SSL_VISION_2010 = 2MESSAGE_SSL_REFBOX_2013 = 3MESSAGE_SSL_VISION_2014 = 4MESSAGE_SSL_VISION_TRACKER_2020 = 5MESSAGE_SSL_INDEX_2021 = 6

Files can optionally contain an index at the end of the file for random access to messages (for fast seeking for example). An indexed log file has a message of type MESSAGE_SSL_INDEX_2021 as the last message. The value of the timestamp is irrelevant. The message is not in protobuf format, but in simple binary format for easy relative access from the end of the file:

1: []Int64 – Array with byte-aligned offsets, starting at the beginning of the file2: Int64 – Offset from the end of the file to the beginning of the index message3: String – Index marker (“INDEXED”) to quickly check if a file is indexed

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2023 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2023
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2023 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

RobôCIn
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce a series of repositories that we plan to submit at this year’s open-source. Hopefully they will help grow our category here at RoboCup.
RobôCIn’s Plans for Future Software Development
rSoccer: https://github.com/robocin/rSoccer

Is an open-source framework to study Reinforcement Learning for SSL;

project-unification: https://github.com/robocin/project-unification
This project aims to demonstrate the use of the soccer-common framework (https://github.com/robocin/soccer-common), developed by RobôCIn and used in the RoboCup SSL and IEEE VSS categories. Also, the repository serves as a starting point to the team’s new developers and teams that want to start strategies on SSL.
Usage examples:

MatheusPaixaoG: https://github.com/MatheusPaixaoG/project-unification
matheuslafayette: https://github.com/matheuslafayette/projeto-seletivo-robocin
agaf2: https://github.com/agaf2/project-unification
acrucha: https://github.com/acrucha/project-unification
caiomvfc: https://github.com/caiovmfc/Seletiva-RoboCin-VSS-cvmfc

robocin-cpp: https://github.com/robocin/robocin-cpp

It is a library heavily inspired by abseil owned by Google, and seeks to extract what worked well from soccer-common, implementing software engineering best practices and modern C++ with a README-by-folder based documentation. It provides the core library for our next team’s robotics applications.

Floating-point comparison;
Angular/geometric operations;
In the long term it will be like libsrc in 2D for our team.

protocols: https://github.com/robocin/protocols
The protobufs used by the competition are widely dispersed in the repositories that require them, making it necessary to copy and paste the files that are currently being used in the category. Thus, the protocols used are highly duplicated in the RoboCup SSL softwares, but also in the team’s strategy softwares.
In this context, we propose a single repository containing the protocols used by as well as installation guidelines for various programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, etc.
robocin-ines: https://github.com/joseviccruz/robocin-ines, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-server, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-webui
robocin-ines provides a base framework for architecting robotic applications. This set of repositories comes as an optimization of our current software (ssl-unification), providing a microservices-based framework which:

Enables the use of different programming languages;
Uses the ZeroMQ framework to communicate services with latency below 1ms;
Defines a visualization on the Web, providing better development simplicity;

However, this final structure is not yet finalized and, as a way to validate the technologies, scope, and robustness of the system, the SSL VAR was developed as an MVP of this repository.
SSL VAR is a match recording system, which allows the viewing of the match in real time, as well as the analysis of past plays through replay at a given timestamp or according to a given event in the match, such as a foul, penalty, or goal. In this way, it allows the human referee to analyze a past play and check whether his decision and also the decisions of the automatic referees were correct or not.
The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a base structure for organizing new SSL teams using microservices, and to extend the life and maintenance of our current software.Best regards, RobôCIn.
RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
RoboFEI would like to submit our hardware and software works for the open-source award. We are happy to say that we have released all the mechanics, electronics, AI, and firmware for this year.
Regarding mechanics, the new robot’s generation is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/ssl-mechanics). The project aims for modularization that will help robot maintenance and assembly.
In electronics, both the main and kick boards have been changed aiming for modularization, besides the fact that the team replaced the FPGA with an STM microcontroller to modernize our robot, and you can see everything here in the link (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2). Besides that, our new firmware is released on our GitLab too (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2).
About the software, our ongoing research of multi-robot path-planning is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/leo_costa/RobotNavigation).
Best regards,
João VictorRoboFEI
ER-Force
Dear Small Size League.
ER-Force would like to submit their current hardware and software framework as well as its autoref for the open source award. [1, 2, 3]
A short summary:
The hardware project reflects the current state of the ER-Force robots, i.e. the new robot generation used by our team during this RoboCup. The hardware is designed in EAGLE (electronics) and Inventor (mechanics). The electronics section contains prebuilt manufacturer files (Gerber) as well as schematics as PDF, the mechanics part is depicted in assembly drawings.
The software framework reflects the open-source simulator as well as some low level algorithms such as our path planning. The software framework is written in C++ and Qt.
Finally, our open-source projects include our well-known autoref, which is used by the league for many years.
Best regards,
MikeER-Force
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-Community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. The usual one-stop shop to get it all was updated:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, firmware, our full AI, and someawesome new tools. Here is a brief description of what has changed.
Mechanics:The dribbler dampening and dribbling bar have changed again to improvetraction on the ball. These are mostly material changes. The axes of thesub-wheels changed to be more robust. The release includes the fullrobot mechanics. Inventor CAD files, but also a STEP file of the full robot.
Firmware:Dribbler current control has been improved near zero velocity. Interfaceto the robot’s raspberry pi has been improved with new messages andfeedback of detected balls. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Pass finding has been largely improved and nowcontains a dynamic learning component. Also watch out for some moreserious dribbling moves which will make you sweat.
RobotPi:The software for ball detection running on a Raspberry Pi 3A+ on each ofour robots. Most of the color blob detection and thresholding has beenrewritten and is parallelized via multi-threading. The RPi uses onlyaround 50% of its CPU now.
TIGERs CLAV (Cut Lengthy Audio/Video):This is an C++ ImGui based application able to cut video files based onan SSL gamelog. You can synchronize multiple videos and gamelogs withindividual markers and the tool can then cut out non-running stages.This tool is still quite new and may not support every video format, butnonetheless it is already a great help to preprocess videos frommatches. Oh and it can create a status overlay video for your videos,too (similar to the status board).
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL community,
Hereby, RoboTeam Twente would like to submit our projects for the Open Source Award.
RoboTeam Twente WikiRoboTeam Twente AI SoftwareRoboTeam Twente EmbeddedRoboTeam Twente AutoRefHigh Speed USB Library for STM32Chat-TDP
Our Wiki provides all the mechanical and electrical designs of our robots. Furthermore, it contains the theoretical background and additional explanations about our AI and control software.On our Github you can find our new path planning within our AI code, as well as our innovative dribbler ball-sensor code (see this year’s ETDP).
This year we created an AutoRef, allowing for a majority vote between all AutoRefs. This software is under active development, but our AutoRef will most likely be used during RoboCup 2023.
Next to that, we developed a high speed USB library compatible with our STM32 chip. This results in an enhanced stability when connecting USB devices to the STM32F676ZI. With minor modifications, this is also suitable for other STM chips.Lastly, our latest innovation is our very own Chat-GPT, containing all information on all the (E)TDPs within the SSL. Just ask your question, and the answer will be provided. This Chat-TDP is currently still under construction, but great progress has already been made and we feel like this could be beneficial for all teams within SSL.
Thank you!

DOCUMENT 470
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2014/robocup-2014-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
Three technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2014, out of which the Double-Size Field technical challenge is compulsory for teams to proceed beyond the round-robins.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committees encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Double-Size Field Challenge
For a team to qualify beyond the round robins, they must successfully participate in the double-sized field technical challenge. Successful participation is declared after scoring at least 2 points. Points will be awarded for the demonstrating the following skills on the double-sized field, where each skill is scored only once:
Taking a kickoff without a force-start (1 point).Scoring a goal against a stopped defense consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders (1 point).Taking an indirect free kick from the goal line without a force start (1 point).Scoring a goal on the stopped defense after a pass between two robots (2 points).Scoring a goal on a moving 3-robot defense after a pass between two robots (4 points).
In addition to these points, additional bonus points will be awarded to teams that play on the double-sized field for actual competition matches:
You get 4 bonus points if you played at least 1 game on the double sized field.For every goal scored in your best (highest scoring) double sized field game you get 3 bonus points. This includes goals from penalty kicks.
Procedure for the Double-Sized Technical Challenge:
The challenge starts with a kickoff.If the team successfully scores a point from the kickoff, the challenge continues according to the normal rules of the game, except all free kicks are awarded to the playing team.If the team is unsuccessful at scoring a point from the kickoff, they may request another kickoff in lieu of a free kick the next time the ball goes out of play.The challenge concludes at either the 5-minute time, or when the team withdraws after scoring at least 2 points.
Automatic Referee Challenge
This challenge will test the accuracy of a team’s autonomous referee software. Software entered in this challenge does not need to be capable of autonomously running an entire game; rather, the intent of this technical challenge is to demonstrate building blocks and provide a solid foundation on which others can build more advanced autonomous referee systems.
A team will be awarded the specified number of points after the software correctly identifies the specified event for the third time (no further points are awarded for additional detections, nor for two or fewer detections of a particular event):
The ball has exited the field, and which team most recently touched it: 1 pointThe RoboCup 2014 rule regarding multiple defenders in the defence area is violated, by which team, and to which extent (partial or full occupation): 1 pointRobots have collided violently, and which team was at fault: 2 pointsThe ball was kicked above 8 m/s, and by which team: 1 pointThe ball was kicked above 15 cm above the field surface and crossed the midfield line before bouncing or touching another robot (a new penalty at RoboCup 2014 defined in section 12.3), and which team last touched the ball before the violation: 2 pointsOne robot is pushing another without the robots first colliding violently, and which robot is pushing: 6 points
Any software that identifies one of the above events when it did not, in fact, occur will lose one point per false positive identification.
To participate in this challenge, all autonomous referees must be designed to receive SSL-Vision and referee box packets from the network to identify game state, and must be configured to avoid sending any packets onto the network.
To avoid any unfair benefit, all participants will simultaneously judge a single live RoboCup game. All autonomous referees will be attached to the field network. A neutral third party will monitor each autonomous referee computer’s display; teams are responsible for making their autonomous referee software easy enough to explain to this third party. Please consider the use of a scrolling log format (this could be as simple as writing messages to standard output), for ease of reading and re-examination of past output. The neutral third party will record each instance of an event identified by the autonomous referee, along with whether the positive identification was true or false.
For the purposes of this technical challenge, a positive identification is considered true if and only if the human referee on duty at the game makes the same call. As the purpose of this challenge is to detect specific events, not to run a complete game, the referee will be requested to announce all relevant events, including those (s)he would not normally call due to e.g. the precedence rules or anticipated benefit rules set out in section 5.2 if the Laws of the Game. The referee will also be requested to consider input from his/her assistant when announcing these events, as some events may happen outside the referee’s line of sight.
In order to be declared as successfully participating in this technical challenge, a team’s autonomous referee software must:
execute for the duration of the game without human input, except that teams are permitted to work on their referee software during half-time and similar scheduled breaks in gameplay (but not during timeouts)have a score of at least two points when the game endshave its source code publicly available, under a license that could not reasonably prevent either other teams or the league from using the software or incorporating the code into their own autonomous referee systems (copyleft open-source licenses such as GPL are acceptable), along with any necessary documentation on compiling and running the software

Dear SSL-community,
as most of you should already know by now, we use to publish all our work each year during or after each RoboCup since we first participated in 2011.
And we continue with this attitude, because we belief in the importance of sharing knowledge to advance our league and the RoboCup.
Below, you will find a list of our publications and a list of the most significant changes. The documentation or description is included within the individual packages.
Mechanics
– Modified the curved front shape of the straight kicking plunger. This significantly reduced the spread of kicked balls when they are not perfectly at the center in front of the robot.
– Enlarged the infrared barrier PCBs on the sides of the dribbling device to prevent the silicon rubbers of the linear damping mechanism to fall out seldomly.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Mechanics-2018.zip
Electronics
– Usage of a new wireless module: Semtech SX1280
– Schematics and PCB layout of a tiny 34x18mm module with a single SX1280 module. Pin-compatible with most nRF24L01+ breakout boards on the market (SX1280.pdf).
– Schematics and PCB layout of a completely new base station using one SX1280 module and the SKY66112 front-end module for enhanced output power and antenna switching. Features network connectivity and a 5″ touchscreen with 800×480 pixels.

Firmware
– Support for the SX1280 and SKY66112 modules (in base station and mainboard code).
– Enhanced wireless transfer protocol to make best use of the new modules.
– Adaption of the base station code to the new hardware (incl. completely new user interface).
– Base station touchscreen supports manual control of a single robot for demonstration purposes.
– Base station can be configured via touchscreen.
– New feature: Asynchronous Bang-Bang trajectories. They are intentionally not synchronized on the X and Y trajectory to reach a specific line/direction faster.
– Major update of robot controller and sensor fusion. The robot now uses a state space controller with acceleration output and model-based friction compensation when a position source (e.g. SSL Vision) is available. If not position source is available, local velocity output is used with a velocity-error correction for encoder readings. All models are derived from empirical data.

Software (TIGERs AutoRef)
– Detect more rule violations
– Updated to new rules
– Significantly improved ball speed detection and chip kick detection (see Vision Filter)
Code: https://gitlab.tigers-mannheim.de/open-source/AutoReferee
Software (AI)
– Enhanced the integrated AutoRef for full automatic simulation of two teams playing against each other
– Offensive Action Trees for self learning offensive behaviors (see ETDP)
– Multiple new supportive behaviors for supporting the attacker
– Improved the selection of the best suited attacker that should handle the ball
– Improved the skills that handle the ball, like kicking, receiving, redirecting, approaching and catching
– Integrated new asynchronous bang bang trajectories into multiple skills
– More robust path planning with ahead-of-time emergency brakeRelease: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gz
Software (Vision Filter)
– New chip kick model: We are now using fixed restitution coefficients for all hops in Z direction, for the first hop in XY direction, and for all further hops in XY direction (3 parameters in total).
– Online straight kick and chip kick estimation has been updated to use a direct simplex-based optimization method.
– Chip kick estimation can now optimize a complete trajectory, not only two hops.
– An additional optimizer can estimate all model parameters for a straight and chip kick with an evolutionary algorithm (CMAES). Model parameters can now be fully calculated within Sumatra, no further external software required.
– The Vision Filter is completey integrated into our official AutoRef software.
– Kick information from  our own robots is now used as a-priori knowledge for estimation.
– The viewport architect, which aligns the viewports of the different cameras and tries to minimize overlap, now supports different modes of how the viewports are calculated. Based on field size, camera positions, camera projections, or dynamically on detected robot positions.
– Correction of inbound SSL Vision timestamps. The average rate of each camera is estimated and the timestamps are corrected for each camera, mitigating network and processing delays. This increases filter accuracy for ball and robots.

Software (status-board)
– A new application for visualizing referee information during a game including new game events that are announced by the autoRefs.
– Additionally, a live view of the field.

Dear SSL Community,
We would like to share our 3D-printed SSL robot designs with you. We think that our design can evolve with help from other community members to become the standard robot design for the SSL teams in the future.Since most teams are getting into the struggle of manufacturing a high number of robots to meet the new rules of the league, we thought it would be good to share this design with other teams so they can save time on the mechanical part of their projects.
In this work, we have made a great focus on 3D-printing technologies. Nowadays, 3D-printers, unlike CNC machines, are widely accessible to individuals and organizations. 
All mechanical documents of our design have been published and will be updated frequently.
