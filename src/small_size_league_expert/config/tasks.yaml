  description: >
    Systematically analyze the input question to detect language and decompose into strategic sub-questions that maximize retrieval effectiveness.

    # CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROCESS:
    Step 1: Language Detection Analysis
    - Identify primary language using linguistic markers
    - Note any mixed-language elements or technical terms
    - Assign ISO language code with confidence level
    - Write the exact same question in English for consistency

    Step 2: Question Semantic Analysis
    - Extract core technical concepts
    - Identify question type (what/how/why/when/where)
    - Determine complexity level and target audience

    Step 3: Field of Knowledge Identification
    - Classify question into SSL-specific domains (technical/rules/strategy)
    - Classify question into general technical domains (algorithms/hardware/software)
    - Identify any cross-domain relationships (e.g., hardware affecting strategy)

    Step 4: Sub-Question Generation Strategy
    - Generate focused sub-questions covering different knowledge domains
    - Ensure each sub-question targets specific retrievable information
    - Validate sub-questions align with available knowledge sources

retrieval_task:
  description: >
    Execute strategic content retrieval using systematic search methodology to gather comprehensive, authoritative information for each sub-question.

    CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROCESS:
    Step 1: Source Prioritization Strategy
    - Analyze each sub-question to determine optimal source types
    - Prioritize MCP SSL-specific sources for domain knowledge
    - Identify Wikipedia needs for general technical concepts
    - Plan search query optimization for maximum relevance

    Step 2: MCP Source Exploitation
    - Execute targeted searches using SSL-specific terminology
    - Retrieve official documentation, rules, and specifications
    - Gather team descriptions and technical papers
    - Extract competition guidelines and historical data

    Step 3: Wikipedia Supplementation
    - Search for general technical concepts not in SSL sources
    - Retrieve foundational knowledge (algorithms, protocols, hardware)
    - Gather context for technical terms and methodologies
    - Supplement with academic and industry standards

    Step 4: Content Quality Assessment
    - Validate source authority and recency
    - Ensure content directly addresses sub-questions
    - Check for completeness and technical accuracy
    - Document source metadata for ranking phase

    SEARCH STRATEGY EXAMPLES:

    Technical Sub-question: "What computer vision algorithms are used in SSL global vision?"
    - MCP Search: "SSL vision system algorithms camera calibration object detection"
    - Wikipedia Search: "computer vision object tracking algorithms stereo vision"

    Rules Sub-question: "What are the official SSL field dimensions?"
    - MCP Search: "SSL field specifications dimensions official rules"
    - Wikipedia Search: "Not needed - domain-specific information"

    Strategy Sub-question: "How do teams coordinate robot formations?"
    - MCP Search: "SSL team coordination formation strategy tactical planning"
    - Wikipedia Search: "multi-agent coordination distributed systems"
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive collection organized by sub-question containing:
    1. Retrieved content snippets with exact source URLs
    2. Source authority level (official/academic/community)
    3. Content relevance score (1-10) for each snippet
    4. Publication date or last update when available
