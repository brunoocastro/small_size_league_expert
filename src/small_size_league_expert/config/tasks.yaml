  description: >
    Systematically analyze the input question to detect language and decompose into strategic sub-questions that maximize retrieval effectiveness.
    
    CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROCESS:
    Step 1: Language Detection Analysis
    - Identify primary language using linguistic markers
    - Note any mixed-language elements or technical terms
    - Assign ISO language code with confidence level
    
    Step 2: Question Semantic Analysis
    - Extract core technical concepts
    - Identify question type (what/how/why/when/where)
    - Determine complexity level and target audience
    
    Step 3: Sub-Question Generation Strategy
    - Generate focused sub-questions covering different knowledge domains
    - Ensure each sub-question targets specific retrievable information
    - Validate sub-questions align with available knowledge sources
    
    FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES:
    
    Example 1:
    Input: "¿Cuáles son las dimensiones oficiales del campo de fútbol robot?"
    Language: es (Spanish)
    Sub-questions:
    1. "What are the official SSL field dimensions in meters?"
    2. "What are the goal area specifications in SSL?"
    3. "What are the penalty area measurements in SSL?"
    
    Example 2:
    Input: "How does the vision system track multiple robots simultaneously?"
    Language: en (English)
    Sub-questions:
    1. "What computer vision algorithms are used in SSL global vision?"
    2. "How does SSL vision system handle robot identification and tracking?"
    3. "What are the technical specifications of SSL vision hardware?"
    
    Example 3:
    Input: "Wie funktioniert die Kommunikation zwischen Robotern im Spiel?"
    Language: de (German)
    Sub-questions:
    1. "What communication protocols are allowed in SSL robot teams?"
    2. "How do SSL robots coordinate during gameplay?"
    3. "What are the communication frequency limitations in SSL?"
  expected_output: >
    A structured analysis containing:
    1. Detected language code (ISO format)
    2. Confidence level for language detection (1-10)
    3. Core technical concepts identified
    4. Question complexity assessment (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
    5. Exactly 3-4 focused sub-questions in English that:
       - Cover different knowledge domains (technical/rules/strategy)
       - Are directly answerable using available sources
       - Maintain semantic coherence with original question
       - Follow the few-shot examples pattern

retrieval_task:
  description: >
    Execute strategic content retrieval using systematic search methodology to gather comprehensive, authoritative information for each sub-question.
    
    CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROCESS:
    Step 1: Source Prioritization Strategy
    - Analyze each sub-question to determine optimal source types
    - Prioritize MCP SSL-specific sources for domain knowledge
    - Identify Wikipedia needs for general technical concepts
    - Plan search query optimization for maximum relevance
    
    Step 2: MCP Source Exploitation
    - Execute targeted searches using SSL-specific terminology
    - Retrieve official documentation, rules, and specifications
    - Gather team descriptions and technical papers
    - Extract competition guidelines and historical data
    
    Step 3: Wikipedia Supplementation
    - Search for general technical concepts not in SSL sources
    - Retrieve foundational knowledge (algorithms, protocols, hardware)
    - Gather context for technical terms and methodologies
    - Supplement with academic and industry standards
    
    Step 4: Content Quality Assessment
    - Validate source authority and recency
    - Ensure content directly addresses sub-questions
    - Check for completeness and technical accuracy
    - Document source metadata for ranking phase
    
    SEARCH STRATEGY EXAMPLES:
    
    Technical Sub-question: "What computer vision algorithms are used in SSL global vision?"
    - MCP Search: "SSL vision system algorithms camera calibration object detection"
    - Wikipedia Search: "computer vision object tracking algorithms stereo vision"
    
    Rules Sub-question: "What are the official SSL field dimensions?"
    - MCP Search: "SSL field specifications dimensions official rules"
    - Wikipedia Search: "Not needed - domain-specific information"
    
    Strategy Sub-question: "How do teams coordinate robot formations?"
    - MCP Search: "SSL team coordination formation strategy tactical planning"
    - Wikipedia Search: "multi-agent coordination distributed systems"
  expected_output: >

    Apply systematic evaluation criteria using chain-of-thought analysis to rank and filter retrieved content for maximum educational value and accuracy.
    
    CHAIN OF THOUGHT RANKING PROCESS:
    
    Step 1: Relevance Assessment Matrix
    For each content snippet, evaluate:
    - Direct answer potential (Does it directly address the sub-question?)
    - Conceptual alignment (How well does it match the original question intent?)
    - Technical depth appropriateness (Matches user's apparent knowledge level?)
    - Scope coverage (How much of the sub-question does it answer?)
    
    Step 2: Authority and Reliability Scoring
    - Source credibility: Official SSL > Academic > Team Documentation > Community
    - Content freshness: Recent official updates > Historical documentation
    - Technical accuracy indicators: References, citations, technical detail level
    - Community validation: Known reliable sources vs unverified content
    
    Step 3: Educational Value Analysis
